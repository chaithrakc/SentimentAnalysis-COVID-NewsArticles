# Sentiment Analysis of COVID News Stories

This project aims to analyze the sentiment polarity of news articles related to COVID-19 from various countries, specifically the UK, India, Japan, and South Korea. The dataset used in this project was collected from IEEE data port and comprises of 10,000 news articles.

The initial step in this project was data cleaning, pre-processing, and exploratory analysis. These processes were carried out to ensure the quality and consistency of the data.

After pre-processing the dataset, the textual data was transformed into numeric vectors using word vectorization techniques. These techniques included the Bag of Words (BOW) model, BERT word embedding, and XLNet embedding, which were used to convert the text data into numerical representations that can be fed into machine learning algorithms.

The sentiment polarity of each news article was predicted using two different models. The Na√Øve Bayes classifier and BiLSTM (Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory) neural network were used to classify the news articles into one of three categories: Negative, Positive, and Neutral.

In summary, this project provides an in-depth analysis of the sentiment polarity of COVID-19 news articles from various countries using a combination of data cleaning, pre-processing, word vectorization techniques, and machine learning models.
