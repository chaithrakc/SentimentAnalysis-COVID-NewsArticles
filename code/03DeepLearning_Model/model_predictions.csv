jonas is among 18 analysts surveyed that have a sell-equivalent rating on tesla, twice the amount that rate the shares a buy. while short interest has declined as the stock rallied in recent months, it remains at about 11 per cent of the free float, according to ihs markit data.
tesla has been on a dizzying rally so far this year, adding 39 per cent in value through wednesday and sending analysts scrambling to boost their price targets. even still, shares took off after the earnings beat with impressive speed, jumping nearly us$80 apiece in less than an hour.
the stock surged as much as 12 per cent to $650.88 in new york, making it the best performer on the nasdaq 100 stock index over the past twelve months.
here’s what else analysts had to say:
wedbush dan ives
neutral, price target us$550
“we would characterize the fundamental performance as impressive, with clear momentum looking ahead as a global inflection in electric vehicle demand appears on the horizon.”
results indicate lower costs, more production efficiency, and “extremely impressive” automotive gross margins
bulls may also focus on the aggressive trajectory of giga 3 production and demand out of shanghai. hitting the important 500,000 delivery threshold for full-year 2020 is well within reach as now, based on wedbush’s chinese demand scenario analysis.
rbc, joseph spak
underperform, price target raised to us$530 from us$315
admits to being “misguided” in some assumptions, and thus, significantly raises his estimates post-results. however, on a reasonable base case, still believes tesla is overvalued.
notes that, despite the “slight” revenue increase, total gross profit and automotive gross profit declined year-on-year.
but “if bulls keep dreaming the dream,” there’s room to run to rbc’s $928 a share upside case.
jefferies, philippe houchois
buy, price target us$600
quarterly earnings were as expected, but free cash flow was two-times consensus. with net debt also lower and 2020 volume guidance above 500,000 there’s room for consensus to move higher.
notes chief executive officer elon musk dismissed raising capital as unnecessary, arguing tesla is not in any way holding back investment.
however, lack of capital expenditure guidance is disappointing, while the unfolding coronavirus creates some uncertainty, with a 1-2 week mandated shutdown in shanghai.
citigroup, itay michaeli
sell, price target us$222
results are another positive, if not impressive, step forward. however, given current market capitalization, don’t see many incrementally supportive data points.
in fact, see some negatives regarding near-term full self-driving capabilities. magnitude of the beat and underlying metrics was underwhelming, while 2020 delivery guidance could be viewed as light versus the guidance given at first quarter 2019.
cautious on chasing the stock amid a number of flaws in the bull case regarding north american demand and tesla’s automated vehicles positioning.
canaccord genuity, jed dorsheimer
buy, price target us$750 from us$515
“essentially flat gross margins compared to the prior quarter were a meaningful feat given the ramp associated with gigafactory shanghai moving to begin production, resulting in an operating margin of 4.9 per cent, and we expect to see that number improve as deliveries of chinese model 3s begin.”
“given the numerous positive data points that were discussed and the cornerstone of continued profitability and free cash flow generation, we view the company as solidly positioned as the leader of the electric vehicle revolution.”

foreign brokerages are bracing for a larger impact on the global markets than what was during the sars outbreak, which also originated in china, back in 2003.
“we expect a bigger and possibly longer macro impact on asia than what was seen during sars. our base case is that 12 months from now, the asian economy will be near where it would have been without the wuhan virus, but we see a sizeable risk of a significantly worse outcome,” credit suisse said in a note.
coronavirus has also been termed as the wuhan virus, as it is believed to have originated from the animal and seafood market of the chinese city. before the outbreak became known, global markets had seen a sharp spurt after the first phase of the us-china trade deal was announced in mid-december. the rally had lifted some of the major global indices to fresh lifetime highs.
dow jones, nasdaq, s&p 500, nifty, sensex and german dax index, had claimed fresh highs in january. brokerages fear possibility of a more protracted outbreak. “sars was basically a one-quarter event, as far as consumer and travel panic is concerned, but the wuhan virus might hurt sentiment for a longer period. if mutation leads to a spanish flu-style second wave, the impact on sentiment could prove prolonged,” analysts at credit suisse said.
so far, asian indices have been worst hit. hang seng is down nine per cent from its mid-january peak, giving up most of the gains (11.5 per cent) it made on the back of the us-china trade deal.
among other asian indices, taiwan taiex is down 6.2 per cent from this year's peak, south korea’s kospi is down 5.26 per cent, and china's shanghai composite is down 4.46 per cent. domestic indices — nifty and sensex — are down 2.6 per cent and 2.5 per cent, respectively.
market experts say that india may be among asian countries which could see lesser impact from the outbreak because of its low connectivity with china. however, they caution that highly bureaucratic structures could hamper the government's ability to fight the disease outbreak. analysts say the outbreak is likely to have a wider global impact, as china's linkage to global trade has grown significantly.
“...while the impact is once again likely to be concentrated on asian consumption (travel will be hard hit), the increased importance of the chinese economy suggests a bigger global drag,” macquaire said in a note. “as china has become an integral part of the global supply chain, any further extension of factory closures would raise risks of temporary supply chain disruptions for multinational companies,” franklin templeton em equity said in its note. the latest estimate from the economist intelligence unit (eiu) shows that a virus of sars-like proportion could reduce china’s real gdp growth in 2020 by 0.5-1.5 percentage points against eiu’s baseline forecast of 5.9 per cent in 2020. further, the assessment showed that a drop of 1.5 percentage points in china’s growth could lead to a 0.2-0.3 percentage points hit on global growth, without factoring in for the potential impact on other asian economies.",[],2020-01-30T21:07:00.000+02:00,2020-01-31T04:26:48.014+02:00,,0.0,22.0,0.0

toronto public health will monitor the patient while he continues to recover at home, where his wife is also in self-isolation.

six buses were led by a police escort to the rear of the hospital and on to a side road leading to the accommodation block, pa media reports.
a medic wearing a white specialist suit was sat next to the coach driver of each vehicle.
the convoy, which also included a number of ambulances, then travelled out of sight.
patients disembarked from behind barriers covering the accommodation entrance but some could be seen inside wearing masks as they walked upstairs to their rooms for the next fortnight.

here’s a bit more detail about the two people diagnosed with coronavirus following some reader questions via email.
they were taken ill at the staycity apartment hotel in york on wednesday and were later confirmed to be the first uk cases of the coronavirus.
it is understood the two guests travelled to the uk from china recently. they are two members of the same family.
they are undergoing treatment in newcastle because it is a specialist airborne high consequence infectious diseases (hcid) centre.
public health england (phe), which is urgently trying to trace those who came into contact with the two people, said steps will be taken to reduce the risk to the public and it is “identifying the areas where there is deemed to be a risk”.
a phe spokeswoman said:
“our public health experts are well trained at assessing risk, and are adopting approaches that they have used in a number of emerging infections to reduce the risk to the public.”

at the staycity hotel on friday, business carried on as usual, with guests continuing to check in for weekend breaks in york despite the firm confirming that two people who have tested positive for coronavirus in the uk had been staying there.
outside the hotel, two guests told the guardian that as recently as friday morning they had been told by reception staff the reports that two tourists had been taken ill from their apartment on wednesday were “lies”.
“this morning they said it was a lie and not to listen to it,” said andy neale, 21, who is staying at staycity for the night with his girlfriend. “it’s not ideal. they should’ve taken some precaution.”
he added that the incident had marred the couple’s getaway, saying: “my girlfriend is stressing out, she’s using hand wipes on everything.”
a family who were staying in the hotel on a visit from asia to see their daughter, who is a student in york, said they had been told the cases were “false information” when they asked staff if reports were true.
helen papakosta, 15, from greece, showed reporters a video she had taken on her phone of people in hazmat suits arriving at the hotel on thursday morning – presumably to deep clean the suite where the affected guests had been staying.
although her mother, chrisa papakosta, 48, whom she had been staying at the hotel with, was unfazed by the event she was “concerned” by it.
a statement from staycity, the chain that owns the hotel, read:
“we have now received confirmation that two guests staying in one of our apartments in york have been tested positive for the coronavirus.
“we have been advised by public health england that there is minimal ongoing risk of infection to either guests or staff, and as such our york property remains open for business.
in due course the apartment concerned will undergo a thorough environmental clean and disinfection by a specialist contractor. we would like to reassure all our guests that we are following official advice on this matter and that the health and safety of everyone working and staying in our properties remains of paramount importance to us.”

following on from the earlier post about health officials urgently trying to trace anyone who came into contact with two people diagnosed with coronavirus, public health england have clarified the definition of close contact.
a new statement defines close contact as coming within two metres of the infected person for 15 minutes.
earlier we reported that sharon peacock, the director of the national infection service at phe, said:
“public health england is contacting people who had close contact with the confirmed cases. the two cases were staying in york when they became unwell.
“close contacts will be given health advice about symptoms and emergency contact details to use if they become unwell in the 14 days after contact with the confirmed cases.
“this tried-and-tested method will ensure we are able to minimise any risk to them and the wider public.”

up to 35,000 passengers could be affected by the cancellation of flights to mainland china by uk airlines, pa media reports:
british airways announced on wednesday it had grounded its daily flights connecting heathrow with beijing and shanghai, after a change in government travel advice relating to the outbreak. it has cleared its schedules until at least the end of february.
virgin atlantic initially continued its flights between heathrow and shanghai, but on thursday night it announced it will suspend the route for 14 days. several chinese carriers are running their usual schedule to uk airports such as heathrow, gatwick and manchester.
global travel and data analytics firm cirium calculated that the decision of british airways and virgin atlantic to suspend flights has affected the travel plans of as many as 35,000 passengers.
peter morris, chief economist at ascend by cirium, said:
“cirium data clearly shows the dramatic impact that coronavirus is having, with nearly 10,000 scheduled flights to, from and within china being suspended between january 23 and 28.
“while the industry is playing its part to help prevent the spread of the virus, the outbreak will inevitably cause significant disruption of schedules and travel patterns in the short and medium term.”

if you are feeling concerned about how coronavirus is spread, here’s a good explainer by my colleagues hannah devlin and ellen wishart.
the wuhan coronavirus outbreak is a new illness and scientists are still assessing how it spreads from person to person, but similar viruses tend to spread via cough and sneeze droplets .
when an infected person coughs or sneezes, they release droplets of saliva or mucus. these droplets can fall on people in the vicinity and can be either directly inhaled or picked up on the hands then transferred when someone touches their face, causing infection.
for flu, some hospital guidelines define exposure as being within six feet of an infected person who sneezes or coughs for 10 minutes or longer.

marvin rees, the mayor of bristol, said the decision to cancel the celebrations at the bristol museum and art gallery had been made after discussions with the city’s chinese community and in solidarity with those affected.
“our deepest sympathies are with chinese friends both at home and abroad who have been affected by coronavirus, and i want to extend my condolences to those who have lost loved ones,” he said.

the united states drew china’s wrath with a travel warning on friday.
russia, britain, sweden and italy all reported their first cases, with rome declaring its own national emergency as it sought to reconstruct the itinerary of two infected chinese tourists.
“do not travel to china due to novel coronavirus first identified in wuhan,” the us state department said, raising the warning for china to the same level as afghanistan and iraq.
beijing, which has only just started to mend tattered trade ties with the us, called that move “truly mean” given the world health organization had commended its containment efforts and not recommended travel or trade curbs.
“the world health organization urged countries to avoid travel restrictions, but very soon after that, the united states did the opposite,” the chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman hua chunying said in a statement. “it’s truly mean.”

japan also advised citizens to put off non-urgent travel to china, while bahrain recommended no travel to any country hit by the virus, and iran and mongolia urged a ban on all travellers from china.
singapore, a major travel hub in asia, stopped entry of passengers with a recent history of travel to china and also suspended visas for chinese passport holders. the ban extends to those just transiting singapore.

the coach company that collected british passengers after they landed in the uk on a flight from wuhan has said its vehicles will be “deep cleaned”.
at least seven coaches from horseman coaches ltd were seen arriving at the brize norton raf base in oxfordshire at around 10am.
the drivers had agreed to take the job, a company spokesman said, and will be given paid leave to “remain at home for the next 10 days”.
the vehicles will also be removed from service for a minimum of 10 days after they are cleaned, the company said.
after several delays, the evacuation flight left wuhan at 9.45am local time on friday, carrying 83 britons and 27 non-uk nationals, mostly from eu countries.
the horseman coaches spokesman told the pa news agency: “the department for health have procedures in place for the vehicles to be deep cleaned.
“that is part of the process of this undertaking, which will happen as soon as the vehicles are clear.”
he added: “i can give everybody assurance that everything will be cleansed sufficiently.”
on arrival in the uk the british passengers on the evacuation flight boarded the coaches and faced the more than three-hour drive to arrowe park hospital in wirral for a quarantine period of 14 days, where they will be housed in an nhs staff accommodation block with access to the internet.
the horseman coaches spokesman declined to comment on whether or not the drivers would also have to be put in isolation, but this was later clarified.
a statement on the company’s facebook page said it had been contacted by the british government on thursday afternoon, adding: “as an extra precaution horseman coaches have decided to take, the drivers involved will take paid leave and remain at home for the next 10 days, and likewise after the cleansing of the vehicles, the vehicles will be removed from service for a minimum of 10 days.”

singapore has announced that it is closing its borders with china. the island nation banned chinese visitors and other foreigners who had been to china in the past 14 days.
the visa suspension will come into effect immediately so travellers can be informed in advance, while the travel restriction will start at 11.59pm on saturday. the government did not say when these restrictions would be lifted.

senate republicans say they’re growing confident that they have the votes to block new testimony in president donald trump’s impeachment trial and acquit him. that would allow them to avoid a potential appearance by former national security adviser john bolton, who reportedly said trump told him that he withheld almost $400 million in military aid to force ukraine to interfere with the 2020 campaign. trump has repeatedly denied there was a quid pro quo, but his lawyers now say that even if there was one, he shouldn’t be removed from office for such a scheme.

chicago ( wgn ) — a chicago woman has infected her husband in the first u.s. case of human-to-human transmission of the new coronavirus, centers for disease control and prevention officials confirmed thursday.
this is the sixth case of the virus in the united states. two are in california, two in illinois, one in washington and one in arizona.
the chicago woman, who is in her 60s, recently traveled to wuhan, china, where the coronavirus was first identified, to take care of her sick father. her husband did not travel to china.
the woman is currently under quarantine at amita health st. alexius medical center in hoffman estates, a village in cook county.
the husband is also hospitalized in stable condition, but health officials did not say where.
local health officials said that the risk of contracting coronavirus for people in illinois remains low.
meanwhile, health screenings are still underway at o’hare airport for those coming in from china. symptoms of the deadly virus include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
the number of cases of the virus in china, where it has killed at least 170 people, shot up to more than 8,100 in mainland china alone by thursday evening, cnn reports.
while the virus originated in the chinese city of wuhan in december, there are now more than 100 cases in 20 other countries and territories spanning asia, north america, europe and the middle east. india and the philippines were the latest to confirm the virus had reached their shores.

it was nothing serious – just a nagging cough and clogged-up head. and it was over before it really began: aggressive doses of extra-strength medicine knocked it out of me after a couple of nights. i was nothing more than one of the thousands of canadians who, at any given time, are battling a little sniffle or scratchy throat.
except i wasn’t.
last weekend brought the announcement of the first case of a novel coronavirus (2019-ncov) in ontario, where a 17-year-old epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) remains only lightly buried in the graveyard of our collective memory. on tuesday, british columbia reported its first positive test for 2019-ncov. on thursday, the world health organization designated the coronavirus outbreak as a global health emergency. and early cases have been linked to the city of wuhan, where about a third of the world’s cases are located, in central china – a country that is increasingly being inescapably writ onto the skin of the two million chinese-canadians like me.
the memory that affirmed that reality for me is lightly buried, too. in 2003, i – an eighth-grade nerd just looking to commute from the suburb of richmond hill, ont., where nearly one-third of residents now identify as chinese, to my downtown toronto high school – was among the chinese-canadians who were treated like an alien because of sars fears.
i remember the weight of the textbook-laden backpack i was trucking that morning. i remember the gratitude i felt when i saw a seat open up on the subway car. and i remember that i’d barely settled into it when the person next to me bolted up, put a mask on his face, and backed away. i remember how he stared at me with disgust.
in that instant, in that man’s eyes, a random kid – a boy born in toronto’s now-shuttered wellesley hospital to remarkable parents who immigrated here from hong kong for school; a boy who had visited the former british colony just twice and grudgingly, given my pubescent dismissiveness toward my chinese culture in pursuit of half-baked notions of western “cool”; a boy who was (embarrassingly, i can now say) repulsed by overt markers of his background, from “chinglish” stumbles to smelly lunches – was boiled down into his essential parts. that is to say: he saw me as chinese by both of the word’s definitions. i was ethnically chinese – han, to be precise, as 92 per cent of china’s population is. i was therefore, in his panic-blinded eyes, from china , and because of my body’s presumed geographic proximity, i was an inherent health risk, even though i was born and forged in canada.
in that moment, and in all the others before and since, i was trying to just be what i was and am: a chinese-canadian. but that was the first time in which someone had denied me that second part of that identity. to that man, there was a hard dividing line in the hyphen between “chinese” and “canadian,” as if ""canadian” was an ethnicity. i couldn’t really be the second because of the fluctuating freight of the first.
for centuries, chinese-canadians have faced ethnic stereotyping. but when sars struck, i couldn’t escape the brand-new clichés that were being inaccurately projected onto the visible colour of my skin: broad ideas and sometimes-thin opinions about china, the country. so this past week, even as others coughed and sniffled around me on buses and subways, i stifled any hint of my slight sickness. i didn’t want people to notice the chinese person who was sick, because i knew – from my own experience – that this could make me suddenly and painfully foreign. i know i wasn’t alone.

just as was the case when sars struck, some canadians seem to be steering clear of people who appear ethnically chinese.
tonny louie, the chair of the toronto chinatown business improvement area, told the globe and mail he noticed a downturn this week, invoking memories of empty dim sum restaurants and plummeting sales in places like pacific mall, north america’s largest chinese indoor shopping centre.
stories from chinese-canadians about being avoided in public spaces have flashed through social media, amid some clamour for panicked, over-broad quarantines, echoing an ipsos poll early into the 2003 epidemic that found that two-thirds of canadians wanted individuals arriving from sars-affected areas to lose their freedom of movement or not be allowed into the country.
and with preposterous conspiracies flying – including baseless ethno-nationalist accusations that the coronavirus was developed as a bioweapon by the chinese state or was stolen by chinese scientists from a winnipeg lab – a woman eating bat soup has quickly become the defining image with which some ignorant online hecklers have responded to the outbreak.
that’s despite the fact that the woman in question, a blogger from china, ate the bat three years ago; the fact that bat soup is not a widespread delicacy in china, but more so in places like palau, where the video was shot; the fact that there is not yet a direct scientific link between the coronavirus and bats specifically, but rather more broadly to the exotic wildlife sold illegally in a wuhan seafood market; the fact that polling suggests chinese citizens are keenly aware of the national problem of food-safety standards; and the fact that chinese cuisine hardly owns the monopoly on unusual foods – as if the west does not savour, say, the livers of force-fattened geese.
these reversions to our basest racial clichés – that being chinese is the same as being unclean – did not happen by accident. there is a long legacy of this here, and the speed with which these fears have spread just reveals how close to the surface irrational racism sits, and how easily it can be channelled by well-intentioned but poisonous panic.

but the coronavirus backlash is just part of the current toxic stew of fear, suspicion, and resentment of chinese-canadians. and as a result, the line that halves the definition of the term “chinese-canadian"" threatens to become even thicker – erasing the identities and histories of those who, regardless of their individual opinions on the matter, have nothing to do with the people’s republic of china or the chinese communist party (ccp).
chinese-canadians are chinese, yes, but we are canadian. the distinction needs to be made. otherwise, the complicated reality of individuals in the diaspora could be lost, and both hoary, centuries-old racial fears as well as any equally irrational and unfair suspicions of the geographic, political and national-security threats that an ascendant nation of china represents to some, could be imposed on anyone who looks chinese.
“there’s this thinking of, ‘you’re all chinese – hong-kong chinese, third-generation born here, doesn’t matter – you’re all visually the same,’ "" said henry yu, a professor of history at the university of british columbia.
“it’s, ‘we’re ascribing to you, the chinese, all the things we don’t like about china too.’ ”
and if this is left unaddressed – as has largely happened, over the course of two centuries – broad sinophobia can fester, potentially setting the foundation for irrational fear to turn into discrimination and for that to harden into social fact.

history has long told chinese-canadians that our identity is whatever canadians allow it to be. the red line was thick when canada’s federal government banned ethnic chinese migrants, regardless of nationality, for more than two decades, or when it imposed a head tax to discourage their arrival, or when chinese immigrants were ghettoized in cheaper, dangerous shanty communities, later glorified as chinatowns.
from the 19th century and into the 20th, the bright red line made the idea that we could be canadian impossible. we were merely and, to many, despicably chinese, prevented from joining up with the nationality we sought; even after we became citizens by law, we were denied the franchise as recently as 1947. the yellow peril – the idea that we represent an existential threat to white labourers and societies because of some kind of inherent work ethic, or that we are dirty dealers in iniquity and therefore unworthy of the west – was a fear that, even in its name, chained itself to the colour they used to describe our skin.
as the decades passed, that began to change. chinese families represent the largest ethnic group of asian canadians, who in turn comprise more than a fifth of canada’s population. we are olympic medallists, members of parliament and veterans, and like any diaspora here we have worked to weave our way into the knotty national fabric.
but increasingly, chinese-canadians’ ethnicity is becoming bound up with the actions of a state that is being seen as a threat to the western world.
the narrative of an ascendant china has loomed since the late 1980s – and as beijing becomes more emboldened, the view of the chinese as a people has become pitched, too. according to a nanos poll from 2012 – well before the heights of the geopolitical rivalry we see today – a plurality of respondents said that china posed the greatest threat to canada’s national security.
a looming decision on whether ottawa will allow major chinese telecom-equipment maker huawei to build part of canada’s 5g wireless-network infrastructure has cast a spotlight on the rising perception that chinese investment is nefarious. huawei insists that it does not act on behalf of the chinese government, but as a private company it’s difficult to accept this on purely good faith, particularly given the warnings from intelligence agencies. that has affected views at large: in december, an angus-reid poll found that 69 per cent of respondents were against ottawa allowing the firm’s contributions, but also that 66 per cent of respondents had a negative view of china.

then add in the case of meng wanzhou, the huawei executive who faces extradition to the u.s. on criminal charges after her arrest in vancouver. canadians of chinese descent – who, regardless of our decidedly non-monolithic array of individual and hard-won opinions about the chinese state, might be uninterested in being automatically bundled up into something most of us have no personal stake in – have been caught firmly in the middle.
beijing’s response has only made things worse. after ms. meng’s arrest, china detained canadian diplomat michael kovrig and businessman michael spavor on charges of espionage, and banned imports of vital canadian canola. these cruel actions are the chinese state’s to bear, but it can be easier to confuse ethnicity and nationality every day the high-profile case absorbs front-page headlines.
this isn’t all that surprising, since the chinese communist party has a habit of complicating things for and hooking itself to the whole cloth of the chinese-canadian diaspora, whether we like it or not. last august, the ccp’s central committee publicly urged people of chinese background in nations like canada – what beijing calls “overseas chinese” – to “remember the call from the party and the people” and “spread china’s voice.” and an april report from the national security and intelligence committee of parliamentarians specifically flagged the ways beijing mobilizes the diaspora to help their efforts. “china is known globally for its efforts to influence chinese communities and the politics of other countries,"" it said. ""the chinese government has a number of official organizations that try to influence chinese communities and politicians to adopt pro-china positions.”
even though some experts and a parliamentary panel have stated that the diaspora has proven largely immune to pressure, the suspicions being engendered certainly make it harder to distinguish between the ethnicity and nationality of chinese-canadians. in fact, that slippery slope makes it all the easier for some opposition to the chinese government to potentially veer toward racial criticisms, the way conspiratorial anti-semitism can occasionally be smuggled under the flimsy scrim of criticism of israel.

to some degree, suspicion of foreigners is a natural consequence of national-security apparatuses identifying states as threats. but richard fadden, the head of the canadian security intelligence service from 2009 to 2013, says the agency was hyper-aware of avoiding any messaging that conflated bad actors in a community with the broader group itself.
still, the idea that active sinophobia could eventually take root in canada is “worrisome,” mr. fadden said in an interview. ""not because tomorrow there will be violence, but that, as with anti-semitism, this could grow under the radar.”
but while politicians and security organizations must tread carefully, that’s not where the real work will have to be done. that’s on us canadians. “csis can manage the message,"" he said. ""but they can’t control how canadians think.”
and then there’s the growing resentment against the chinese, perhaps best expressed by vancouver’s housing crisis. multiple reports have laid the blame for the city’s unaffordable housing market on foreign ownership, mostly from china. in response, the government imposed a 2016 tax on foreign buyers, and later, a speculation tax.
the evidence behind these measures, however, is murky. in the 14 months after the foreign-buyers tax came into force, the percentage of home purchasers in metro vancouver who weren’t canadian citizens, permanent residents or who didn’t have work permits plunged from 14.8 per cent to an average of 3.23 per cent ; affordability remains an issue. and so when there are headlines like “vancouver’s hot housing market just got tougher for wealthy chinese” or "" vancouver has been transformed by chinese immigrants”, it’s little wonder that the word “chinese” has begun to lose all sense of meaning.
the construction of the bogeymen of greedy, uber-wealthy chinese and the over-stated prevalence of their tax-dodging “satellite families” are animated by a similar fear as the one that spurred yellow peril: the idea that “these people” are coming here to out-compete canadians and take what isn’t theirs. and it has neatly folded into the existing archetypes people can reach for in times of panic – much as the image of “bat soup” has.

china first informed who about cases of the new virus in late december. to date, china has reported more than 7,800 cases including 170 deaths. eighteen other countries have since reported cases, as scientists race to understand how exactly the virus is spreading and how severe it is.
experts say there is significant evidence the virus is spreading among people in china and have noted with concern instances in other countries — including the united states, france, japan, germany, canada, south korea and vietnam — where there have also been isolated cases of human-to-human transmission.
speaking to reporters in geneva, who director-general tedros adhanom ghebreyesus noted the worrisome spread of the virus between people outside china.
""the main reason for this declaration is not because of what is happening in china but because of what is happening in other countries,"" he said. ""our greatest concern is the potential for this virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems which are ill-prepared to deal with it.""
""this declaration is not a vote of non-confidence in china,"" he said. ""on the contrary, who continues to have the confidence in china's capacity to control the outbreak.""
a declaration of a global emergency typically brings greater money and resources, but may also prompt nervous governments to restrict travel and trade to affected countries. the announcement also imposes more disease reporting requirements on countries.
in the wake of numerous airlines cancelling flights to china and businesses including starbucks and mcdonald's temporarily closing hundreds of shops, tedros said who was not recommending limiting travel or trade to china.
 ""there is no reason for measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade,"" he said. he added that chinese president xi jinping had committed to help stop the spread of the virus beyond its borders.
""during my discussion with the president and other officials, they're willing to support countries with weaker health systems with whatever is possible,"" tedros said.
on thursday, france confirmed that a doctor who was in contact with a patient with the new virus later became infected himself. the doctor is now being treated in an isolated room at a paris hospital. outbreak specialists worry that the spread of new viruses from patients to health workers can signal the virus is becoming adapted to human transmission.
china raised the death toll to 170 on thursday and more countries reported infections, including some spread locally, as foreign evacuees from china's worst-hit region returned home to medical tests and even isolation.
russia announced it was closing its 2,600-mile border with china, joining mongolia and north korea in barring crossings to guard against a new viral outbreak. it had been de facto closed because of the lunar new year holiday, but russian authorities said the closure would be extended until march 1.
meanwhile, the united states and south korea confirmed their first cases of person-to-person spread of the virus. the man in the u.s. is married to a 60-year-old chicago woman who got sick from the virus after she returned from a trip to wuhan, the chinese city that is the epicenter of the outbreak.
the case in south korea was a 56-year-old man who had contact with a patient who was diagnosed with the new virus earlier.
although scientists expect to see limited transmission of the virus between people with close contact, like within families, the instances of spread to people who may have had less exposure to the virus in japan and germany is worrying.
in japan, a man in his 60s caught the virus after working as a bus driver for two tour groups from wuhan. in germany, a man in his 30s was sickened after a chinese colleague from shanghai, whose parents had recently visited from wuhan, came to his office for a business meeting. four other workers later became infected. the woman had shown no symptoms of the virus until her flight back to china.
""that's the kind of transmission chain that we don't want to see,"" said marion koopmans, an infectious diseases specialist at erasmus university medical center in the netherlands and a member of who's emergency committee.
koopmans said more information was needed about how the virus was spread in these instances and whether it meant the virus was more infectious than previously thought or if there was something unusual in those circumstances.
mark harris, a professor of virology at leeds university, said it appears that the spread of the virus among people is probably easier than initially presumed.
""if transmission between humans was difficult, then the numbers would have plateaued,"" he said. harris said the limited amount of virus spread beyond china suggested the outbreak could still be contained, but that if people are spreading the disease before they show symptoms — as some chinese politicians and researchers have suggested — that could compromise control efforts.
the new virus has now infected more people in china than were sickened there during the 2002-2003 outbreak of sars, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, a cousin of the new virus. both are from the coronavirus family, which also includes those that can cause the common cold.
the latest figures for mainland china show an increase of 38 deaths and 1,737 cases for a total of 7,736 confirmed cases. of the new deaths, 37 were in hubei province, of which wuhan is the capital, and one was in the southwestern province of sichuan. outside china, there are 82 infections in 18 countries, according to who.
china extended its lunar new year holiday to sunday to try to keep people home, but the wave of returning travelers could potentially cause the virus to spread further.
china has been largely praised for a swift and effective response to the outbreak, although questions have been raised about the police suppression of what were early on considered mere rumors — a reflection of the one-party communist state's determination to maintain a monopoly on information in spite of smart phones and social media.
that stands in stark contrast to the initial response to sars, when medical reports were hidden as state secrets. the delayed response was blamed for allowing the disease to spread worldwide, killing around 800 people.
dr. jeremy farrar, director of britain's wellcome trust, welcomed who's emergency declaration.
""this virus has spread at unprecedented scale and speed, with cases passing between people in multiple countries across the world,"" he said in a statement. ""it is also a stark reminder of how vulnerable we are to epidemics of infectious diseases known and unknown.""",[],2020-01-31T02:00:00.000+02:00,2020-01-31T14:38:19.003+02:00,,0.0,47.0,0.0

and coordinator xiaowen guo assures us, there is no risk, ""as they arrive in the country, they came through numerous screenings already. they arrived in los angeles, they have very stringent screenings and have performed in numerous cities already.""
a few performers even arrived before the outbreak. so those in attendance aren't worried, ""i was not worried about it, we had done some research and looked into it,"" said erin mckee, who took her kids to see the show. william added, ""i didn't even know that was a thing so i wasn't worried about it at all.""

islamabad: as the death toll from the deadly coronavirus continue to rise, the fake news on social media regarding the issue is creating panic among the masses, reported the news .
a social media post circulating on the internet claimed that punjab’s health and food authorities have determined mutton as the carrier of the deadly virus and recommended that it should be avoided.
later, the punjab food authority issued a denial and clarified the situation. amid global concern over the outbreak, the social media users are sharing no of suggestions to treat or prevent the disease.
one such claim — shared 16,000 times on facebook — advised users in the philippines to keep their throat moist, avoid spicy food and ""load up on vitamin c"" in order to prevent the disease. the post claims that the information was shared by the country's health department but no such advice could be found on the its website or any official press releases related to the outbreak. also read: coronavirus detection kits from japan to arrive in pakistan today
journalists and fact-checkers have found similar posts with identical or slightly altered wording being circulated on facebook and whatsapp groups in canada, pakistan and india.
another unsubstantiated claim shared online recommended that cold or preserved food and drinks, such as ice cream and milkshakes, should be avoided for ""at least 90 days"", said the report.
the advice was shared by a facebook page called forchange. the post also had a video of a parasite being removed from a person's lips, implying that the procedure was somehow related to the coronavirus.
however, fact-checkers have clarified that the video was three months old and has no link with the virus. facebook has since marked the forchange post as ""false information"" but dozens of identical messages are still being circulated on the platform.
the world health organisation has asked the public to avoid consuming ""raw or undercooked animal products"" as a precaution to the new coronavirus. it has also said that currently there are no vaccine against the virus but standard recommendations to prevent the infections should be adopted. also read: russia to shut border with china over coronavirus
these include regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing and sneezing or, failing that, with the crook of your arm, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs, avoiding close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness, such as coughing or fever.
since it’s an outbreak, people have been speculating the origins of the disease. the speculations took a tall when a slew of videos alleged that the consumption of bats was the reason behind the deadly outbreak in wuhan. one such clip shows a smiling chinese woman holding a cooked bat on camera, before admitting it tastes ""like chicken meat"". the video prompted outrage online, with some users blaming chinese eating habits for the outbreak.
however, the video was not even shot in china. it was also four-years-old and showed popular blogger and travel show host mengyun wang during a trip to palau, an archipelago in the western pacific ocean.
the clip resurfaced on social media after cases of the new coronavirus emerged in wuhan late last year. following the online backlash, wang apologised, saying she was ""just trying to introduce the life of local people"" to the audience and had not known that bats could be a virus carrier. her video has since been taken down. also read: australian scientists have 'game changer' in fight against coronavirus
the new coronavirus is believed to have emerged from illegally traded wildlife at a seafood market in wuhan. although bats have been named in recent research from china as a possible source of the virus, bat soup is not particularly commonplace in the country and the investigations into its exact origins continue.
after the us reported its first case of the coronavirus last week, several patented documents started to circulate on twitter and facebook which claimed that health experts were aware of the virus’ existence.
one of the first users to float these allegations was a conspiracy theorist and youtuber jordan sather.
in a lengthy thread, sather posted a 2015 patent filed by the pirbright institute in surrey, england, that talks about developing a weakened version of coronavirus for potential use as a vaccine to prevent or treat respiratory diseases. the thread has been retweeted a thousand times since.
sather used the fact that the bill & melinda gates foundation was a donor to both pirbright and vaccine development, and alleged that the current outbreak was deliberately manufactured to attract funding for the vaccine.
""and how much funding has the gates foundation given to vaccine programs throughout the years? was the release of this disease planned? is the media being used to incite fear around it?"" sather tweeted.
however, pirbright's patent was not for the new coronavirus. the news reported that the patent covers the avian infectious bronchitis virus, a member of the wider coronavirus family that infects poultry. as for the speculation regarding the bill & melinda gates foundation, pirbright spokeswoman teresa maughan told buzzfeed news that the institute's particular work with the infectious bronchitis virus was not funded by the foundation. biological weapon
another baseless statement that has gone viral claimed that the virus was part of china's ""covert biological weapons programme"" and was leaked from the wuhan institute of virology.
many accounts pushing the theory cite two widely-shared washington times articles both of which quote a former israeli military intelligence officer for the claim. however, the articles cited no evidence to back the claim. the israeli source also said that ""so far there isn't evidence or indication"" to suggest there was a leak.
the two articles have been shared by various different social media accounts that have a following of millions.
the daily star also published a similar piece last week in which it alleged that the virus might have ""started in a secret lab"". however, the piece was amended and clarified that there was no evidence for the claim.
another claim inaccurately linked the virus to the suspension of a researcher at canada's national microbiology laboratory.
virologist dr xiangguo qiu, her husband and some of her students from china were removed from the lab following a possible ""policy breach,"" according to a report by canada's national broadcaster cbc last year. police told cbc news there was ""no threat to public safety"".
another report said dr qiu had visited the wuhan national biosafety laboratory of the chinese academy of sciences twice a year for two years. a tweet with more than 12,000 retweets and 13,000 likes - claimed without evidence that dr qiu and her husband were a ""spy team"", had sent ""pathogens to the wuhan facility"", and that her husband ""specialised in coronavirus research"".
none of the three claims in the tweet can be found in the two cbc reports and the terms ""coronavirus"" and ""spy"" do not appear even once in either.
cbc has since reported that these claims are baseless. also read: these tips can help you avoid the coronavirus
different versions of a ""whistleblower"" video, alleged to have been taken by a ""doctor"" or a ""nurse"" in hubei province, have racked up a million views on various social media platforms and mentioned in numerous online reports.
the most popular version was uploaded to youtube by a korean user, and included english and korean subtitles - the video has since been taken down.
according to the english subtitles, the woman is a nurse in a wuhan hospital. however, she does not claim to be either a nurse or a doctor in the video at all. this seems to be merely an assumption on the part of those who have uploaded various versions of the video to social media.
the woman, who does not identify herself, is wearing a protective suit in an unknown location. however, her suit and mask do not match the ones worn by medical staff in hubei.
due to a lockdown being enforced by the authorities, it is difficult to verify videos from the province. but she makes a number of unsubstantiated claims about the virus, making it unlikely for her to be a nurse or a paramedic.
she also claims the virus has a ""second mutation"", which can infect up to 14 people. but the world health organisation has preliminarily estimated the number of infections an individual carrying the virus can cause is 1.4 to 2.5.
""she doesn't sound like someone from [a] medical professional background,"" muyi xiao, a wuhan native and the visuals editor for the chinafile online magazine, told the bbc .

cape town (miningweekly.com) – the fallout from the coronavirus in china is expected to have a ripple effect on many sectors in the chinese economy, slow down its economic growth and impact on its coal industry and imports.
coal trader noble resources research head rodrigo echeverri says the impact has been severely disruptive. so far, more than 7 700 people have been infected by the virus, which has resulted in more than 170 deaths. millions of people have been placed under quarantine and are unable to travel.
“it’s very disruptive in the places where supply chains and commodities are located.” echeverri told delegates at the fifteenth annual southern african coal conference this week.
he said this had impacted heavily on steel mills in coastal china, as well as on manufacturers, many of which had been forced to slow down. many employees have also been unable to get back to their workplaces in these highly industrialised areas.
“the bad news is that the first quarter of 2020 is going to be pretty bad in terms of business activity in china,” said echeverri. the virus had unraveled the good position china had been in. global research and consultancy group wood mackenzie (woodmac) agrees that the restriction of labour movement is likely to have a significant impact on the chinese economy this year.

a ""wet market"" in wuhan, china, is catching the blame as the probable source of the current coronavirus outbreak that's sweeping the globe.
patients who came down with disease at the end of december all had connections to the hunan seafood market in wuhan china. the complex of stalls selling live fish, meat and wild animals is known in the region as a ""wet market."" researchers believe the new virus probably mutated from a coronavirus common in animals and jumped over to humans in the wuhan bazaar.
i visited the tai po wet market in hong kong, and it's quite obvious why the term ""wet"" is used. live fish in open tubs splash water all over the floor. the countertops of the stalls are red with blood as fish are gutted and filleted right in front of the customers' eyes. live turtles and crustaceans climb over each other in boxes. melting ice adds to the slush on the floor. there's lots of water, blood, fish scales and chicken guts. things are wet.
at the tai po market, a woman who runs a shellfish stall — she only wants to give her name as mrs. wong — says people blame wet markets for spreading disease. but she says that's not fair. like just about everyone else in the market. wong is wearing a surgical face mask because of the coronavirus outbreak. she's heard about the links between the wet market in wuhan, china, and the coronavirus but doesn't think something like that would happen in hong kong.
""it's much cleaner in the hong kong markets. it's so different from what's happening in mainland china,"" she says. ""when i go to mainland china and i'm trying to eat something, i'm concerned about what's in the food.""
meanwhile, this kind of market is not just an asian phenomenon. there are similar markets all over the world — places where fish, poultry and other animals are slaughtered and butchered right on the premises.
but researchers of zoonotic diseases — diseases that jump from animals to humans – pinpoint the wet markets in mainland china as particularly problematic for several reasons. first, these markets often have many different kinds of animals – some wild, some domesticated but not necessarily native to that part of asia. the stress of captivity in these chaotic markets weakens the animals' immune systems and creates an environment where viruses from different species can mingle, swap bits of their genetic code and spread from one species to another, according to biologist kevin olival , vice president for research at the ecohealth alliance. when that happens, occasionally a new strain of an animal virus gets a foothold in humans and an outbreak like this current coronavirus erupts.
the tai po market in hong kong does have some live animals besides the seafood but the selection is rather boring compared to the exotic assortment of snakes, mammals and birds on offer in some markets in mainland china. they're known to sell animals such as himalayan palm civets, raccoon dogs, wild boars and cobras.
the only live birds in tai po are chickens, which are kept behind the butchered pork section of the market.
chan shu chung has been selling chicken here for more than 10 years. he says business is really good right now because the price of pork — his main competition — is through the roof. pork is in short supply due to trade tensions between china and the u.s. and a recent bout of swine flu. a chicken for sale at the tai po market in hong kong. customers say that buying chickens that are slaughtered on the spot makes them feel that they're getting meat from fresh, healthy birds. jason beaubien / npr
so people are buying more chicken. customers can select a live bird from chung's cages. chung pulls them out by their feet, holds them upside down to show off their plump breasts. if the customer is happy with the bird, chung puts a plastic tag with a number on the chicken's foot. he gives the customer a matching tag, sort of like a coat check. fifteen minutes later the shopper can come back and pick up the chicken meat.
chung says he and his colleagues do their best to keep the area clean. they wash down the stalls regularly and disinfect the countertops to stop germs from spreading.
chung, however, is one of the few people in the market who is not wearing a face mask. face masks have become so common in hong kong since the coronavirus outbreak started that pharmacies across the city are sold out of them.
chung says he isn't afraid of this new coronavirus. he always gets his annual flu shot so he believes he's protected against this new disease, even though scientists say the flu shot will not protect people against this new coronavirus.
chung adds confidently that he's even immune to sars — for which there also is no commercially available vaccine.
but he does keep his chicken stalls incredibly clean, which public health officials say is one important step in stopping the spread of diseases. so maybe he's on to something. copyright 2020 npr. to see more, visit https://www.npr.org. © 2020 krcu","['https://www.ecohealthalliance.org/personnel/dr-kevin-j-olival', 'https://ecohealthalliance.org/personnel/dr-kevin-j-olival', 'https://www.npr.org.', 'https://npr.org.']",2020-01-31T16:12:00.000+02:00,2020-01-31T18:28:52.009+02:00,,0.0,52.0,0.0

bryant’s retired no. 8 and no. 24 lakers jerseys were left uncovered in the upper left corner of the arena. following the video tribute, there was 24 seconds of silence followed by “kobe, kobe” chants before the national anthem.
the clippers wore no. 24 shooting shirts during pregame warmups, while coach doc rivers and his staff wore ties and shoes honoring bryant.
“i’m glad it’s behind us. this will help us a little bit,” rivers said.
the tribute was a preamble to the lakers’ return to staples center on friday night against portland for their first game since bryant’s death. their scheduled game tuesday against the clippers was postponed out of respect for the grieving franchise and city. advertisement
george, who grew up in the los angeles area, said during the video: “we gather tonight in the house that kobe bryant built to honor and remember him. he was as synonymous with southern california as the sunshine and touched every inch of it.”
george said after the 124-103 loss to the kings that he quickly accepted a request to narrate the video when he was called earlier in the week.
“from this point on it is always going to be tough, especially being here in la. i think every time we are in this arena and being reminded of him being in the rafters,” george said.
rivers added that he thought the video was well done and something definitely needed by fans and both teams.
both rivers and kings coach luke walton said they had mixed emotions entering the arena. rivers said he has received a lot of pictures from people showing him and bryant together.
“everywhere you go, you are reminded. it has been a tough week for the whole city and that’s ok,” rivers said.
walton, a former lakers player and coach, said he walked around la live shortly after the kings arrived early thursday morning. he added it was an emotional scene with people still outside mourning bryant at 2 a.m.
“you think you’re doing fine and then you walk into staples center. it is still really hard and a lot of emotions that continue to come back,” said walton, a teammate of bryant’s on two lakers championship teams. “i try to focus on what an inspiration he is to me and others, which helps.”

a toronto hospital says a man with novel coronavirus who was being treated there has now been discharged and is recovering at home.
the man in his 50s travelled to toronto from china last week and was canada’s first case of the virus.
there are three confirmed cases in the country — another ontario case is the first patient’s wife, and there is one in b.c. — all are linked to recent travel.
sunnybrook health sciences centre says in a statement today that the man’s health has improved over the past week to the point where he no longer requires in-patient care.
toronto public health will monitor the patient while he continues to recover at home, where his wife is also in self-isolation.
the novel coronavirus has now infected almost 10,000 people around the world.
the spike in the number of new cases prompted the world health organization to declare the outbreak a global health emergency on thursday.
canadian officials have said the measures to prevent the spread of the illness in this country are working and there’s no need to change the plans.

""no new university-sponsored travel for faculty or staff will be approved to china until further notice,"" the message continued. ""any already approved faculty or staff trips will be evaluated on case-by-case basis.""
mu spokesman christian basi said no one from the university — including faculty, staff or students — are now in china.
the only university-sponsored visit to china this semester, a visit to shanghai as part of the semester at sea program, was canceled, he said. the group will instead extend the time it spends in ho chi minh city in vietnam.
the outbreak began in the chinese city of wuhan and has sickened nearly 7,800 people and killed more than 170, most in china, the associated press reported. the world health organization on thursday declared the virus a global emergency, noting that cases have been reported in 18 other countries and the first case of a person in the united states infected by someone who brought the virus back from china was reported in chicago.
the infected person is the husband of a chicago woman who got sick from the virus after she returned from the epicenter of an outbreak in china.
it was the sixth u.s. case of the virus, a close cousin to the sars and mers viruses that have caused outbreaks in the past.
speaking to reporters in geneva, who director-general tedros adhanom ghebreyesus noted the worrisome spread of the virus between people outside china.
“the main reason for this declaration is not because of what is happening in china but because of what is happening in other countries,"" he said. “our greatest concern is the potential for this virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems which are ill-prepared to deal with it.""
numerous airlines have canceled flights to china and businesses including starbucks and mcdonald's have temporarily closed hundreds of outlets.
whether the mu travel ban will have any impact on faculty is uncertain, basi said, because there's no central repository for faculty trips.
faculty who wish to go despite the ban will not be reimbursed for their expenses, basi said.
""i'm not aware of any canceled trips at the moment,"" basi said,
the message from cartwright and ramchand recommends faculty members who have scheduled trips to china to contact associate provost chris riley-tillman.
the message also recommends that all members of the university community avoid leisure travel to china until travel restrictions are lifted, based on guidance from the centers for disease control and prevention.
there have been no reported cases of the virus at mu or in missouri, the message reads.
""the immediate health risk to the american public is considered low at this time, but we will remain vigilant and monitor this closely,"" reads the message from cartwright and ramchand.
symptoms of the coronavirus include fever, cough and difficulty breathing. the message recommends anyone who has traveled to wuhan, china, or has been in contact with someone has traveled there and feels sick to seek medical care. never miss a story

the move by the china council for the promotion of international trade (ccpit), officially accredited with beijing's commerce ministry, was announced late on thursday and comes with the death toll in the country from the virus topping 200. the number of cases confirmed worldwide has risen rapidly in what the world health organization has declared a global health emergency.
""some chinese companies have suffered severe impacts on goods and logistics and may not be able to fulfil their contracts amid the coronavirus,"" the ccpit said in a statement.
it didn't identify any companies affected, and didn't disclose whether it had received any requests for force majeure certificates, which can absolve parties of liability for contracts that can't be fulfilled due to extraordinary circumstances beyond their control.
the ccpit said companies that can provide legitimate documents, including proof of delays or cancellation of transportation, exports contracts and customs declaration, to it online system would be granted force majeure certificates. the agency says on its website that its certification is recognised and accepted overseas.
the outbreak in the world's second-largest economy has roiled global commodity markets, raising fears of weaker demand and disrupting raw material supply chains. a chinese government economist has forecast the country's economic growth may drop to 5%, or even lower, from 6.1% in 2019.
china has extended the lunar new year holiday to at least feb.2. but some regions, such as oil refining hub of shandong province and automakers clustered chongqing city, have asked companies not to resume operations before feb. 10, in a bid to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.

researchers are looking to other coronavirus outbreaks such as sars and mers to determine how this new outbreak is spreading.
australia's deputy chief medical officer professor paul kelly says coronavirus is spread by close contact over a period of time and it's ""virtually totally safe"" to walk past someone in the street who may be infected.
it's spread by a droplet in a cough or a sneeze, similar to how influenza is passed on.
infectious diseases physician sanjaya senanayake says droplets settle about one metre away, unlike airborne viruses which are more worrying because they can travel further distances.
droplet spread also means the particles don't stay in the air for long, making infection less likely unless close contact occurs for a long period of time.
""if you're walking past someone on the street it's a fairly low risk,"" associate professor senanayake told aap.
""coronavirus may not be the easiest infection to get but it can be transmitted in several ways.""
it could, for example, potentially spread if a person with coronavirus stands on a street corner coughing for a while and then leaves before someone else walks past.
it could also be spread via contaminated surfaces if someone touches their nose or mouth after touching a surface that has been coughed or sneezed on by an infected person.
it could also be spread through blood, urine and faeces, prof senanayake said.
surgical masks can help stop the spread of coronavirus but they have to be fitted properly and can't be worn for too long.
associate prof senanayake insists masks are not necessary in australia right now.
""if we start to get lots of cases of local transmission then things are different,"" he said.
prof kelly says coronavirus does seem to spread more easily than sars and mers, but isn't as infectious as measles which can be transmitted to another 12 to 18 unvaccinated people by one infected person.
""for the droplet infection it tends to be between one and two extra people which is still a concern,"" prof kelly told reporters on thursday.
""we will continue to (see an) increase over a period but it's definitely not as transmissible or as dangerous as measles."" latest articles",[],2020-01-30T21:07:00.000+02:00,2020-01-31T17:50:03.003+02:00,,0.0,19.0,0.0

attaining the projected growth rate of 6-6.5% will be challenging. the demand cycle is yet to pick up in india. global growth including india is likely to be significantly impacted by the coronavirus factor, taking cues from the history of impacts from the sars outbreak. we can possibly infer a significantly higher government spending in the next fiscal from these projected growth numbers and will have to await the budget announcements tomorrow for the same.”

the data scan by the economic survey suggests that the economic slowdown may be tapering with green shoots visible in a few quarters of the economy. india can take advantage of the global situation as india remains an attractive investment destination because of the untapped potential of the domestic demand and massive infrastructure spending plans; rising number of millennials in the population (impacting both the nature of consumption and workforce); and the rapidly evolving entrepreneurial ecosystem. all eyes are now on tomorrow’s budget as the government walks a tightrope of balancing growth and inflation.

we echo the economic survey’s comment that the government must expedite reforms to usher in a strong economic rebound in fy2021. this is particularly critical given the limited room, if any, for further monetary easing, with the headline cpi inflation likely to remain sticky above the mpc’s medium-term target of 4% until september 2020.
moreover, a concerted nudge by the government to reboot the virtuous cycle of investment-led growth, as advocated by the survey, would be crucial for economic growth to revive to the upper end of the range of 6.0-6.5% forecast for fy2021, and eventually feed into the goal of expanding the indian economy to usd 5 trillion.

realizing economic growth targets and attaining national aspirations call for not just renewed focus and investment in key sectors like infrastructure and rural empowerment, but also on establishing and enabling a climate of trust. consequently, the survey’s emphasis on strengthening india’s trust economy and on the creation of simpler and speedier contractual enforcement regimes are indeed most welcome.
the focus of the survey on further simplifying processes involved in setting up new businesses, as well as on facilitating business aspirations at a district level is in accordance with its overarching goal of equitable and universal wealth creation.

novena global lifecare (ngl)’s (through its subsidiary novena bellagraph healthcare) donation is the first of its kind from singapore company and coincides with the world health organisation (who) declaration of the wuhan epidemic as an international emergency. the medical supply donation will benefit medical organisations in china including those in wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, which is facing a serious shortage of medical supplies such as surgical masks, medical gloves and clothing etc.
singapore, novena global lifecare (the ""company"" or ""ngl""), one of asia’s largest integrated medical healthcare and aesthetic companies, with over 250 clinics in 20 cities mainly in the asia-pacific region, will donate up to one million masks & other medical supplies to hospitals in china including wuhan, the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak in china. as a company with a significant presence in north asia, ngl (through its subsidiary novena bellagraph healthcare) hopes to do its bid to help win the fight against the outbreak. ngl will work with the following organisations such as the china youth charitable foundation, a national non-profit and non-governmental organisation based in china, and shanghai ruijin hospital medical team, which is sending an emergency medical support team to oversee the wuhan treatment center, also known as the jinyintan hospital, as well as the shanghai center for disease control and prevention (scdc) to help ship the medical supplies from overseas sources to china. the outbreak of the coronavirus epidemic has caused an acute shortage of healthcare supplies as people rush to buy items such as surgical masks, gloves and hand sanitisers. ngl’s donation in medical supplies is timely given that the world health organisation (who) has just declared the wuhan epidemic as a public health emergency of international concern (pheic). this declaration means that, among other measures, national health authorities around the world are recommended to step up their monitoring, preparedness and containment measures. the pheic status also pushes nations to coordinate funding, personnel and other resources, and helps countries persuade residents to follow health recommendations. ngl’s executive chairman and co-founder, mr nelson loh, said: ""the coronavirus epidemic once again reminds us of how small the world is and how we are all living in the same global village. as a regional healthcare player, we want to do our part in minimising the risk exposure to the virus and we hope our movement will spark more regional companies to step up in aid.""""we hope the aid will provide the necessary protection for the frontline healthcare workers in wuhan, who are working tirelessly to contain the spread of the coronavirus and treat the sick at ground zero."" ngl’s ceo and co-founder, mr terence loh, said: ""we decided to reallocate a portion of our medical resources which was originally intended for our shanghai flagship novena bellagraph hospital project to this cause as we felt it was the right thing to do. ngl remains ready to contribute in any way in countries where ngl operates in as and when needed."" about novena global lifecare novena global lifecare (ngl) is one of the largest integrated

more face masks will be distributed to students, health workers, and residents of the city of manila, mayor francisco “isko moreno” domagoso announced late thursday following the department of health’s confirmation that the philippines now has its first confirmed 2019 novel coronavirus (ncov) case.

the 38-year-old patient came from wuhan, china on jan. 21 and was confined in an undisclosed hospital in manila on jan. 25, health secretary francisco duque iii said in a press conference.
in a live broadcast, domagoso said about 1,000 face masks have already been distributed to residents of the 896 barangays in manila even before the health department’s announcement, but the city government has purchased additional face masks for distribution.
the local chief executive warned pharmacies and medical supplies stores against increasing the prices of face masks to take advantage of the surge of buyers.
“profiteering under existing laws or rules is prohibited. if you continue doing that, we will make you criminally liable,” he said.
“canceling business permits is one thing, but you can be held criminally liable if you do profiteering in this situation.”
the city mayor also called on restaurants to refrain from serving “exotic” food, especially those that are not cooked well.
“nananawagan ako sa mga restaurant, huwag muna kayong mag-handa ng mga hindi masyadong normal, mga exotic food (i am calling out to restaurant workers, do not serve exotic food for now),” he said.
“we respect your culture, but please. ‘yung mga nakasanayan niyo, baka sa inyo mabuti yan, pero baka sa pangkalahatan, hindi mabuti yan (the things you are used to may be good for you, but not for everyone).”
domagoso reminded the public to always disinfect their hands, strengthen their immune system by drinking lots of water and taking vitamins, and refrain from going out, especially when sick.
the city mayor also told his constituents to only share verified information to prevent sowing panic among the public.
the local chief executive was not able to confirm whether the 2019-ncov patient was confined at san lazaro hospital. however, he said that if that were true, health workers have better chances of containing the illness because the hospital specializes in infectious diseases.

the thai government has decided to charter an aircraft from a commercial airline, rather than a military transport plane, to evacuate thai people trapped in the chinese city of wuhan, prime minister prayut chan-o-cha said today (wednesday).
he explained that the change is intended to avoid potential difficulties pertaining to international aviation.
he added, however, that it will be the chinese authorities who determine whether the thai people there are clear of coronavirus infection, in which case they will be allowed to leave china.
the chinese government has recently allowed japan to evacuate its citizens from wuhan, the first country to be granted such access. 206 japanese citizens were evacuated, four of whom had a fever and/or a cough.
regarding the control of the spread of the virus in thailand, the prime minister reiterated that his administration has taken stringent preventative measures to cope with the situation and is fully up to date with the situation and information abroad.
he said that, while screening of arriving and departing chinese tourists, the thai government must remain sensitive to maintaining the good relations between thailand and china.
he stressed that it is important that thailand has confidence that china, the country which was the source of the coronavirus outbreak, is capable of containing the virus.
meanwhile, deputy prime minister and commerce minister jurin laksanavisit assured the public that there are enough face masks to meet demand for protection against both the virus and pm2.5 dust in the atmosphere.
about 30 million face masks are produced each month and the internal trade department called a meeting today with the manufacturers to ensure that there will be a sufficient supply to meet public demand, while preventing hoarding or high pricing by profiteers. tags:",[],2020-01-29T14:07:00.000+02:00,2020-01-31T01:02:07.015+02:00,,0.0,11.0,0.0

the world health organization announced thursday that the outbreak of a deadly and fast-spreading strain of coronavirus constitutes a global health emergency.
""over the past few weeks, we have witnessed the emergence of a previously unknown pathogen, which has escalated into an unprecedented outbreak and which has been met by an unprecedented response,"" who director-general tedros adhanom ghebreyesus told reporters in geneva.
however, tedros was adamant that ""the main reason for the declaration is not because of what is happening in china but because of what is happening in other countries. ... let me be clear — this vote is not a declaration of no confidence in china."" he said that the who is deeply concerned about what will happen if the virus begins spreading in countries with weak health systems and that the purpose of the declaration is to help those countries.
the declaration of a global health emergency can work to galvanize international funding. according to the who's procedures , the three criteria for such a declaration are that it is an ""extraordinary event,"" that it ""constitute[s] a public health risk to other states through the international spread of disease"" and that it ""potentially require[s] a coordinated international response.""
the last time the who announced an international health emergency was in july 2019 over the ebola outbreak in the democratic republic of congo. before that, international emergencies were declared in 2016 for the zika virus and in 2014 for the ebola outbreak in west africa.
also on thursday, the u.s. state department issued a ""do not travel"" advisory for china.
""do not travel to china due to novel coronavirus first identified in wuhan, china,"" the advisory reads. ""those currently in china should consider departing using commercial means. the department of state has requested that all non-essential u.s. government personnel defer travel to china in light of the novel coronavirus.""
the new coronavirus has sickened around 9,800 people worldwide and killed at least 213 , all of them in china.
the who said in a statement that ""all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, contact tracing and prevention of onward spread"" of the virus.
""there is no reason for measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade. who doesn't recommend limiting trade and movement,"" tedros added. but the who also said that in certain circumstances, such as when there are many cases of transmission among a vulnerable population, such measures could be ""temporarily useful.""
the coronavirus drew worldwide attention after chinese authorities began reporting cases of pneumonia in the city of wuhan last month. they were able to pinpoint the cause to a previously unknown strain. other forms of coronavirus, such as sars and mers, have been responsible for past international outbreaks.
health authorities believe this particular strain, known as 2019-ncov, likely first spread from an animal. china's national health commission has said it is associated with exposure at a seafood market in wuhan that also sold live animals.
since then, the virus has spread from wuhan to countries around the world, including the united states, japan, singapore and thailand. ""the vast majority of those cases are still associated with travel to wuhan,"" said dr. michael ryan, executive director of the who's health emergencies program.
""we know that this virus can cause severe disease and that it can kill, although for most people it causes milder symptoms,"" tedros told reporters last week. the who said that about 20% of those infected experience severe illness .
experts find the new coronavirus particularly concerning for several reasons. first, the who said there is evidence that the virus could spread from human to human. ""the disease is mainly a respiratory disease passing via droplets from one person to another and mostly still through close contact,"" ryan said.
the droplets could come from sneezing, coughing or even talking. this is worrying because it is easier for a virus to spread quickly between humans compared with a virus transmitted from an animal to humans. human-to-human transmission has now been documented in three countries outside china, tedros said.
second, experts still don't know for certain what animal the virus originated from in wuhan. ""until we know what the animal is, there potentially could still be animals being sold in markets all across china that is spilling virus over into people,"" matthew frieman, a virologist with the university of maryland school of medicine, recently told npr's nurith aizenman .
and third, chinese authorities say the virus has also infected medical workers — people who already would be taking serious precautions to protect themselves.
there is currently no targeted drug to treat the virus, chinese health authorities said. and there is no vaccine to guard against it. tedros is calling on countries to ""accelerate the development of vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics.""
several countries, including the u.s., have started to evacuate citizens from wuhan because of concerns about the coronavirus. as npr's bill chappell reported , american passengers broke into cheers after their flight from wuhan touched down tuesday night in alaska. the centers for disease control and prevention is advising that travelers ""avoid all nonessential travel to all of [china].""
major airlines, such as united airlines and british airways, have suspended flights to chinese cities.
chinese health authorities recently announced new sweeping measures to try to contain the new coronavirus by implementing a strict quarantine on wuhan, a city of some 11 million people. ""there's no sense of when the quarantine might be lifted,"" npr's emily feng reported from beijing. ""the big problem is that people are going to have to return to work soon, when the lunar new year is over. many of them are coming from villages where there are very few screening measures for the virus.""
china's government has come under criticism for not responding more quickly to the outbreak. but who officials have praised the chinese response.

tiger airways says it's in the process of contacting affected passengers and crew members, and would direct them to see their doctors.
anyone who was on the flight has also been urged to call queensland health to ensure they take the safest and most appropriate action.

(xinhua/chen junxia)
geneva, jan. 30 -- world health organization (who) director-general tedros adhanom ghebreyesus said thursday that the novel coronavirus outbreak has become a public health emergency of international concern (pheic).
speaking at a press conference after a closed-door meeting of the emergency committee, he stressed that the who disfavors or even opposes imposing travel or trade restrictions on china.
under the international health regulations (ihr), the who director-general has the authority to determine that an outbreak constitutes a pheic when certain conditions are met. the designation is aimed at mobilizing more international resources to deal with the epidemic.
since the ihr entered into force in 2007, the who has made multiple pheic declarations.
ghebreyesus noted that chinese president xi jinping personally commands and deploys the prevention and containment efforts.
""the speed with which china detected the outbreak, isolated the virus, sequenced the genome and shared it with who and the world are very impressive, and beyond words. so is china's commitment to transparency and to supporting other countries,"" he said.
""in many ways, china is actually setting a new standard for outbreak response,"" he added.
that reflects not only china's high sense of responsibility for the lives and health of its own people, but also its strong support for global disease prevention and control, he said.
ghebreyesus said he believes that china will effectively contain and eventually defeat the epidemic, adding that china's efforts to combat the disease deserve respect and appreciation, and are worth learning.
in fact, many of the prevention and containment measures china has taken far exceed relevant requirements for dealing with emergencies, and the measures china has taken are good not only for that country but also for the rest of the world.
now the situation is still developing and more research is needed, and particularly countries with fragile health systems should enhance their responses, said the who chief.
that is the main reason behind the pheic declaration, he said, adding that considering global health security, it is also a necessary step to achieve a scientific, rational and calm response based on evidence, and to help other countries take scientific, reasonable and appropriate measures to prevent the epidemic.
wu zunyou, chief epidemiologist of the chinese center for disease control and prevention, said that the pheic declaration is a standard practice of the who.
""china's current prevention and control measures are the strictest and very effective. we are confident that we can effectively contain the epidemic and finally overcome it,"" wu said.

the coronavirus is expected to hit australian sectors exposed to the chinese market, including tourism, education and retail, the hardest.
investment bank ubs on friday published a report exploring the implications of the virus - which has killed 213 people - that estimated a two-month halt on china package tours could cost australia at least $1 billion in services exports.
in 2003, the report outlined, short-term arrivals from china constituted just seven per cent of australia's total inbound tourism - but this number has since ballooned to roughly 30 per cent.
adding to the potential pain, ubs pointed out that february and march were two of the busiest months for chinese travellers to australia, making up about one quarter of annual arrivals.
the ubs report also said major shopping centre operators like vicinity centres and scentre group could suffer from lower numbers of chinese ""tourist shoppers"".
""reduced chinese tourism will impact foot traffic and disproportionately impact sales in flagship assets, cbd assets and certain dfo (outlet) centres,"" it said.

many of them may have to resort to production cutbacks if the health crisis worsens in china, where entire cities have been under lockdown due to the disease outbreak, according to industry executives. while the march quarter should be easy to manage, most of the impact will become clear in a month or so, they said.
the fact that the coronavirus outbreak happened during the chinese new year holiday period helped companies as they had to plan in advance for this quarter.
“if they are unable to solve this by 15 february, that will impact the manufacturing dependent industry from march onwards,"" said s.n. rai, co-founder and director of lava. rai said companies would have stocked up in advance for the january to march segment.
“the situation will be very precarious if this continues for another 15-30 days, because in the electronics industry you can’t manufacture even if one component is missing,"" he added.
devita saraf, founder, chairman and ceo of television manufacturer vu technologies, said that it might be too early to make assessments right now. she said that while summer inventories for television companies might be hurt, this quarter shouldn’t see much impact.
essentially, a prolonged disruption will see production capacities going down but little change in demand for electronic products in india.
that said, rai added that costs aren’t expected to increase at the moment, and if they do then companies will have to pass them on to customers. however, he added that market-level shortages won’t reflectfor at least four weeks right now.
arvinder khurana, president of the all india mobile retailers association, said that based on his conversations with mobile phone companies such as realme, oppo and vivo, among others, that assemble products in india, stocks or prices of products shouldn’t be impacted. he said most smartphone makers have started assembling products in india, which means they already have components for this quarter.
“brands have components and stocks for an entire quarter in advance usually, so there shouldn’t be any impact in this quarter,"" he said.
if the disruptions extend for more than a month, production could be seriously hurt, suggested n.k. goyal, president of cellular manufacturers association of india. he said that even today 80% of all components are imported from china, which means there will be a shortage even for companies making in india if the coronavirus lockdown extends over a month.
the disruptions are also expected to affect global giants such as apple inc. in its first quarter earnings report, apple had set an unusually wide revenue guidance range of $63-67 billion in view of the uncertainty.
government warnings asking citizens to refrain from travelling to china have already forced companies to cut down on travel. three people aware of the matter said the employees of xiaomi, realme, vivo and oppo phones had to halt all travel to and from china. as a result, employees who had travelled to china for the chinese new year are unable to return to india, while others had to cancel their plans to travel to china.
further, many of the chinese companies also depend on their chinese units for software r&d. this is the side of the business that takes care of smartphone user interfaces, apps and other software. while some of them also have indian units for r&d as well, any core issue can only be solved from china.",[],2020-01-31T01:58:00.000+02:00,2020-01-31T04:24:46.001+02:00,,0.0,26.0,0.0

ftse 100 index closed firmly in the red thursday as the strong pound did for the dollar earning blue-chip index.
sterling was boosted by the decision by the bank of england earlier to keep rates on hold - part of a 7-2 vote by the policy committee in favour of a patient approach.

mahony added: ""from a monetary standpoint, things remain on a knife edge given the volatility of both inflation and growth likely in the months ahead."" 4pm: ftse stabilised
london’s leading index has stabilised in the afternoon session, albeit well below 7,400, after a busy day for corporate and macroeconomic updates.
the ftse 100 was down 99 points (1.3%) at 7,385. in the us, the main benchmarks are faring better than the footsie, with the dow and s&p 500 down by around 0.6% after the release of fourth-quarter us gross domestic product (gdp) numbers.
“4q19 us gdp growth came in at 2.1%, the same as in 3q, but the growth mix shows weakening consumer spending while business investment continues to languish. trade stability may provide a better platform for 2020 growth, but coronavirus worries could undermine it,” said ing economics.
the unchanged fourth-quarter gdp annualised growth number was slightly above the 2.0% increase economists had been expecting.
“the details show slower consumer spending growth and weak business investment being offset by another strong residential investment figure, robust government spending and a plunge in imports resulting in a major contribution from net exports to the headline growth rate,” said james knightley, ing’s chief international economist.
meanwhile, the bank of england proved it is possible to make a big splash by doing nothing – in this case, leaving its base rate unchanged – although the downward revision of its uk growth forecasts also had economists pondering.
“no mpc [monetary policy committee] member felt compelled to join michael saunders and jonathan haskel for an immediate interest rate cut. despite some recent dovish comments earlier in january by mpc members (silvana tenreyro, gertjan vlieghe and mark carney) indicating that they could favour a near-term interest rate cut if the economy failed to quickly show improvement after the election, they clearly decided that there had been enough evidence of this to sit tight for now at least,” speculated howard archer, the chief economic advisor to the ey item club.
“the mpc also noted that global growth had appeared to stabilise and that there had been a reduction in trade tensions. the bank considered it was too early to judge the impact of the coronavirus. the bank of england also noted possible support to uk growth from the budget,” he added. 2.35pm: us indices open lower
us indices opened lower but quickly set about reducing their losses.

sterling has perked up following the bank of england 's decision to leave its key lending rate unchanged and that's weighing on the footsie.
london's index of heavyweight shares is now nursing a triple-digit fall, down 102 points (1.4%) at 7,381.
“sterling set off higher on basis that no additional members called for a cut this time round (7-2 in favour of hold) despite comments from the likes of vlieghe, tenreyro and carney himself suggesting that further accommodation in the short term may be warranted; however, the fact that very little has actually changed, i feel it’s the correct decision for the committee to sit on their hands for now, outlooks remain subdued but with ‘early signs that growth is picking up’ it makes sense to await further data,” suggested john goldie, the foreign exchange strategist at argentex group plc ( lon:agfx ).
rupert thompson, the chief investment officer at kingswood, reckons the so-called “boris bounce” staved off a base rate cut that was looking increasingly more likely.
“if as is likely, the bounce in the soft sentiment data is sustained and over coming months feeds through to some improvement in the hard economic data, rates will very likely remain on hold. indeed, further out, the mpc is still talking of the need for some modest tightening of policy if the economy recovers as it expects,” thompson noted. the pound gains after the bank of england keeps interest rates on hold in governor mark carney’s final meeting https://t.co/u5ichommdh pic.twitter.com/lbmvklt3nx — bloomberg (@business) january 30, 2020 12.05pm: bank leaves its key lending rate unchanged

the bank also cut its growth forecasts for the uk economy. it now expects gross domestic product (gdp) will rise by 0.8% this year, having previously looked for growth of 1.2%.
gdp is tipped to rise 1.4% in 2021, compared to the central bank's previous forecast of 1.8%, while the 2022 forecast has been trimmed to 1.7% from 2.0%. 11.50am: not long now until the bank of england coin toss
the decision on whether the bank of england will cut its key interest rate today is too close to call, according to daiwa capital markets.
ahead of the meeting of the bank's monetary policy committee (mpc), the ftse 100 was down 69 points (0.9%) at 7,415, less than a dozen points above its low mark for the day.
“the prior two mpc meetings saw two external members – haskel and saunders – vote for a 25bp [quarter point] rate cut and since the start of the year, three further members – vlieghe, tenreyro and carney himself – suggested that they would be ready to vote for a rate cut if the economic recovery anticipated in the boe’s november base case forecast was unlikely to materialise. so, certainly, there is a potential majority in favour of a rate cut today and the economic case for a rate cut looks strong too,” daiwa said.
“on balance, we expect the majority of members to keep bank rate at 0.75% for a little longer yet, while also raising further the possibility of a near-term rate cut if and when the economic data fail to improve sufficiently over the near term; however, we would certainly not be surprised if the mpc voted for a 25bp rate cut today for risk management reasons and we maintain our forecast that bank rate will be cut to 0.5% by may at the latest,” daiwa added, giving a masterclass in hedging its bets.
“i’m still in the cut camp,” admitted neil wilson of markets.com.
“harder data has turned notably softer and the boe doesn’t want to risk allowing weakness to become entrenched. whilst pmi and cbi survey data did evince something of a boris bounce there should be sufficient doubts about whether this will be maintained to warrant a pre-emotive cut,” wilson said. 11.35am: investor confidence subsided in january - and that was before the coronavirus outbreak hit big
although we probably did not need telling, state street global markets has revealed that investor confidence declined in january.
the financial services provider's global investor confidence index (ici) fell to 76.5 from december’s revised reading of 79.7.
the north american ici fell 3.4 points to 68.2 and the european ici dropped 3.9 points to 105.5.
“it is telling that the confidence of european investors has continued to fall. this is similar to the first round of asset purchases from the european central bank (ecb) that the promise of buying has as big – if not bigger – signalling effect for investors than the action of buying itself,” said michael metcalfe, the head of global macro strategy at state street global markets.
“meanwhile, the cut-off date for this reading (1/22/2020) means that the potential impact of the escalated contagion from the novel coronavirus on sentiment will not be captured this month,” he noted.

shares in british airways owner international consolidated airlines group ( lon:iag ) fell 2.1% after the british flag-carrier said it would suspend flights to and from china for a month. 10.55am: uk economic sentiment improves
the european commission's economic sentiment indicator (esi) for the uk rose to 91.5 in january, from 88.2 in december.
“the economic sentiment indicator is moving in the right direction, albeit a bit more slowly than other survey indicators,” opined samuel tombs, the chief uk economist at pantheon macroeconomics.
“the headline number is a tad disappointing; the esi merely rose to a five-month high in january and remains well below its long-run average but the manufacturing component of the esi has a ludicrously high 40% weight, even though the sector accounts for just 10% of uk gdp,” grumbled tombs.
“meanwhile, the consumer sentiment indicator—a seasonally adjusted version of gfk’s survey, released tomorrow—rose to -6.5—its highest level since august 2018—from -7.1 in december. the election result clearly has not boosted consumer sentiment as much as business confidence, though the former had less scope to rebound,” tombs suggested.
“indeed, consumer sentiment in january slightly exceeded both its post-referendum average and its average since the survey began in 1985. as a result, momentum in real disposable income growth, facilitated by low inflation, supportive fiscal policy, falling mortgage rates and reviving employment growth, should feed through to solid growth in households’ spending in the first half of this year,” he added.
the ftse 100 was down 55 points (0.7%) at 7,428. 10.05am: warm response to evraz and unilever's updates limits the damage
if nothing else, today’s jam-packed results schedule has distracted the market from fretting about the coronavirus.
in the circumstances, a 34 point (0.5%) fall to 7,450 for the ftse 100 is not a bad result, thanks to positive responses to trading updates from evraz plc ( lon:evr ) and unilever plc ( lon:ulvr ) offsetting loud raspberries for the updates from bt and shell.
the fourth-quarter trading update from evraz plc ( lon:evr ) sent the shares to the top of the footsie leaderboard, with a 3.0% rise. the russian steel maker reported a 2.1% quarter-on-quarter increase in output in the final three months of 2019.
unilever plc ’s ( lon:ulvr ) decision to review its continued ownership of its tea brands had a revivifying effect on the share price, which rose 1.4%.
“unilever is looking to offload its tea business amid declining demand in developed markets for traditional black tea,” reported markets.com's neil wilson.
“the company is carrying out a strategic review of the business. surely the move to ever-greater coffee consumption in the west has been a drag on tea sales as we swap out our cup of assam for giant mugs of arabica. it comes not long after the disposal of the spreads business which similarly fell prey to changing consumer trends in developed markets,” wilson ventured. 9.20am: footsie falls early on
the ftse 100 index dropped back in early trade on thursday reflecting weakness in global markets amid worsening fears over the impact of the coronavirus.
meanwhile, earnings disappointments from oil giant royal dutch shell plc ( lon:rdsa ) ( lon:rdsb ) and bt group plc ( lon:bt.a ) added to the grim mood.

""the market’s fears weren’t helped by the fed on wednesday evening. as the central bank kept rates unchanged, while re-upping its commitment to 2% inflation, jerome powell refused to speculate on the full impact of the coronavirus, though he did acknowledge the potential for any economic disruption in china to spill over to the us.""
on currency markets, sterling was around 0.3% lower versus both the euro and the dollar ahead of news due at midday from latest bank of england monetary policy committee meeting.
spreadex 's campbell said: ""it is clearly anxious about this afternoon’s knife edge bank of england meeting. the big question is, will mark carney oversee a nasty goodbye, the mpc cutting interest rates in his last appearance as governor, or will that decision be punted to the andrew bailey era? there’s evidence for both, be it the uk’s contracting economy in november or the suggestion of a return to growth by january’s flash pmis."" proactive news headlines:

“it (the flight) is certainly coming to a military base in the uk and then the british nationals will go to the nhs facility for 14 days of quarantine,” he said without specifying exactly where the passengers would be taken. nick gibb says brits with signs of coronavirus infection could be left in wuhan
a foreign office spokeswoman said the government was doing all in its power to evacuate brits wishing to leave.
she said: ""we are doing everything we can to get british people in wuhan safely back to the uk.
""a number of countries’ flights have been unable to take off as planned. we continue working urgently to organise a flight to the uk as soon as possible.
""we remain in close contact with the chinese authorities and conversations are ongoing at all levels."" what are countries across the world doing about coronavirus?
a downing street source previously suggested the britons returning from wuhan had agreed to be placed in ""assisted isolation"".
they said: ""we are expecting about 200 british nationals to be on board, there is capacity on the flight for everybody.
""on arrival, passengers will be safely isolated for two weeks with all necessary medical attention.""
british airways previously suspended flights to and from mainland china amid the outbreak, which has now spread to every region of the nation.

the coronavirus is expected to hit australian sectors exposed to the chinese market, including tourism, education and retail, the hardest.
investment bank ubs on friday published a report exploring the implications of the virus - which has killed 213 people - that estimated a two-month halt on china package tours could cost australia at least $1 billion in services exports.
in 2003, the report outlined, short-term arrivals from china constituted just seven per cent of australia's total inbound tourism - but this number has since ballooned to roughly 30 per cent.
adding to the potential pain, ubs pointed out that february and march were two of the busiest months for chinese travellers to australia, making up about one quarter of annual arrivals.
the ubs report also said major shopping centre operators like vicinity centres and scentre group could suffer from lower numbers of chinese ""tourist shoppers"".
""reduced chinese tourism will impact foot traffic and disproportionately impact sales in flagship assets, cbd assets and certain dfo (outlet) centres,"" it said.
the coronavirus impact is not likely to continue and sales are likely to pick up again, ubs said.
but if there are bankruptcies of shops during the slow time then it will impact retail occupancy rates. latest articles",[],2020-01-31T04:37:00.000+02:00,2020-01-31T17:46:49.005+02:00,,0.0,10.0,0.0

hospitalisation of people suspected of coronavirus infection has brought out systemic issues in airport screening and quarantine facilities in mumbai.
a 36-year-old man who was admitted to the quarantine ward in mumbai’s kasturba hospital has claimed there were neither in-flight announcements nor enquiries at the chhatrapati shivaji maharaj international (csmi) airport for passengers, including those returning from china, to report cases of cough, cold or fever. he also claimed the hospital, an official isolation centre, maintained poor infection control system.
the patient, who was on a business tour with three others to guangzhou and shushan, in china, for six days, told the indian express : “i had a cold before the trip. in china, i developed a fever once. there we didn’t realise the scale of the coronavirus outbreak.”
on landing at csmi airport on january 22, he claimed that no announcement were made inside the rwandair flight on possible coronavirus infection. at the airport too, he claimed, no official informed him to report if he had any symptoms for the virus.
“i still had a cold when i landed, but i easily passed through immigration and went home. the next day, i realised the extent of the outbreak. my office first got me tested and then reached out to the airport authorities, who directed us to kasturba hospital,” he said. he and his colleague, a 31-year-old woman, were admitted to kasturba hospital on january 23, while their two other colleagues were quarantined in delhi.
while the 36-year-old man claimed he had not come across a thermal scanner, a csmi spokesperson said two such scanners have been positioned in aerobridges for air china and rwandair flights. “we direct these flights to those aerobridges. the scanner can detect high body temperature from a distance of three metres,” the spokesperson said.
a thermal scanner is a hand-held device. at airports in other countries, each passenger is screened using the device. at the mumbai airport, it is mounted atop a tripod and can only detect fever, but not cough and cold. “that is why we encourage self-reporting by people,” the official said, adding that more passengers in flights from hong kong may soon be screened.
till now, 4,846 passengers have been screened at the airport, but none have been referred to kasturba hospital for quarantine. most passengers have themselves reported to authorities a day or more after exiting the airport.
dr sadhana tayade, director of directorate of health services, said she held a meeting with airport officials on wednesday. “they have strengthened the screening system. they also plan to reach out to other airlines to make in-flight announcements for passengers to report coronavirus symptoms,” she said.
on thursday, as the 36-year-old man and his colleague were discharged from kasturba hospital after a second test for the virus came negative. he later told the indian express that the municipal hospital had poor prevention control mechanism. “we were scared that if any patient had coronavirus, we would all be at risk. the infection would circulate within the ward,” he said.
the hospital’s isolation unit maintains no separate air conditioning, and only has windows for ventilation. there remains no negative pressure in the ward to prevent cross-infection. the 10-bedded quarantine facility has four rooms, a bed in each, and a general ward with six beds.
“it used to be cleaned 4-5 times a day, the staffers wore masks, but that is it,” he added.
a state health official said kasturba hospital has been directed by state and central governments to improve its infection prevention mechanism. training will also be given to staffers to handle the suspected cases.
two foreigners admitted to kasturba hospital
two foreigners were admitted at the isolation ward of kasturba hospital on thursday and two indians in pune’s naidu hospital for suspected coronavirus infection. across the state, 11 people remain in isolation wards.
according to officials, 21-year-old woman, a resident of china, landed in mumbai on january 25. she developed symptoms of the viral infection on tuesday, and was admitted to the quarantine ward of kasturba hospital on thursday.
another woman, aged 32, arrived in mumbai on wednesday from beijing and developed symptoms the same day. she was also admitted to kasturba hospital on thursday. currently, five persons are admitted in isolation wards in mumbai and pune each, and one in nanded. for all the latest mumbai news , download indian express app tags:","['https://indianexpress.page.link/aeiu', 'https://www.indianexpress.page.link/aeiu']",2020-01-30T23:45:00.000+02:00,2020-01-31T00:19:29.012+02:00,,0.0,43.0,0.0

as the world health organization declares a global health emergency over the coronavirus outbreak, the university of chicago medical center (ucmc) has established a protocol should the hospital need to treat infected patients.
unlike during the ebola virus epidemic in 2014 , however, the ucmc is not one of chicago’s designated facilities to deal with infections should they arise locally. on thursday, ucmc infection control program director rachel marrs clarified that every hospital is individually capable of screening for infections.
the ucmc is operating under criteria set by centers for disease control and prevention which encompass clinical features such as fever, coughing or difficulty breathing alongside epidemiological risks such travel to the disease’s epicenter, wuhan, china. other factors include close contact with a confirmed or an under-investigation ill person.
should patients meet those criteria, the ucmc would seek cdc approval to test for coronavirus and send blood and respiratory samples to cdc headquarters in atlanta for confirmation.
the ucmc has no designated, preemptive unit for coronavirus cases. marrs said screening at the hospital would occur at entry points like clinical appointments or the emergency room followed by testing as necessary and finding an appropriate, nearby facility for treatment.
“we are prepared, if we have a patient, that we could treat them here,” marrs said, though she said any hospital could care for infected patients.
marrs observed that the cdc currently thinks the novel coronavirus is more contagious than sars or mers, which belong to the same family of viruses, but is less deadly. nevertheless, marrs said the new virus is still evolving and said she could not predict what the cdc would find as far as its infectability and mortality.
the united states reported its first person-to-person transmission of the coronavirus on jan. 30, as a woman who contracted the infection in wuhan infected her spouse in chicago. in a statement , illinois department of public health director ngozi ezike said the risk to the general public in illinois is low.
“local, state and federal health officials are working to identify those who have had close contact with the individual,” said ezike, ordering “protective measures to minimize further spread of the virus.”
chicago public health commissioner allison arwady said there is no local emergency at this time and told residents that they do not need to cancel events, avoid mass gatherings or don masks or gloves in public.
“currently, there’s not widespread activity,” marrs said, adding that much depends on the result of the who emergency and whether more flights are canceled to and from china. “i think our response has to be based on risk to both our patients and the community.”

apple will release a high-tech tag device for tracking everyday items and new high-end headphones alongside the iphone se 2 (pictured) in march, a report has claimed.
mr kuo’s prediction’s were made in a research note from investment management firm tf international securities, a copy of which macrumors have reported seeing.
‘we forecast that apple’s major new hardware products in [the first half of 2020] include the 4.7-inch lcd iphone, ipad pro, macbook pro/air, smaller wireless charging mat, uwb tag, and a high-end bluetooth headphone,’ he apparently wrote.
unconfirmed reports have been widely circulated that apple is developing a low-cost iphone with a 4.7-inch screen and a touch id home button.
this product — which is thought could retail from $399 (£304) in the us — may launch as soon as march 2020.
airtags are apple’s rumoured tracking system for the ‘find my’ app.
each will be small, circular and made for attachment to everyday items.
if said items are lost, pressing a button in the ‘find my’ app will cause the tag to make noise to help you locate it.
‘safe locations’ will let you share the locations of your items with friends and family and ‘lost mode’ can be activated if the item cannot be found.
if the item is found by a fellow iphone user, they can check the tag to find its owner and send an alert via the app.
rumours that apple is developing item tracking tags — as popularised by tile — first surfaced in the september of last year when macrumors released leaked screenshots of an item-tracking sub menu being developed for integration within the ‘find my’ app.
the tracking tag product has reportedly been given the code-name ‘b389’ during its development and will potentially be sold under the ultimate name ‘airtags’.
as with the iphone 11 range, mr kuo believes that the airtags will support the use of so-called ultra wide-band radio technology, which would allow the tags to be located with a much greater degree of accuracy than would be possible using bluetooth low energy or wi-fi.

mr kuo reportedly expects apple to release high-end, bluetooth enabled headphones — although he did not provide more specifics.
these could, however, be the apple-branded over-ear headphones that bloomberg had previously reported were under development.
little is known either about the rumoured small wireless charging mat — although it would follow in the wake of the highly-anticipated airpower charging mat that was cancelled last year following quality concerns.
had it been realised commercially, however, the airpower mat would have been capable of charging an iphone, apple watch and airpods case at the same time — reportedly regardless of where on the mat each device was placed.
little is known about the rumoured small wireless charging mat — although it would follow in the wake of the highly-anticipated airpower charging mat, pictured, that was cancelled last year following quality concerns
apple is also expected to release revamped versions of their ipad pro and macbook pro and/or air products.
an ipad pro with a triple-lens rear camera system — such as seen in the iphone 11 released last year — and 3d sensing for augmented reality are anticipated to be unveiled as early as march.
suggestions that new macbook air or pro models might be on the horizon lines up with previous speculation that a 3-inch macbook pro with a scissor switch-based magic keyboard will launch by june 2020.
mr kuo also noted that — in a worst-case scenario for the tech firm — the impacts of the present coronavirus outbreak could result in apple having to delay the quality assurance and mass production schedules for upcoming products
mr kuo also noted that — in a worst-case scenario for the tech firm — the impacts of the present coronavirus outbreak could result in apple having to delay the quality assurance and mass production schedules for upcoming products.
foxconn — a primary manufacture of apple products — has its iphone factory located in henan province, adjacent to hubei province in which the virus appeared.
‘if there are no significant improvements regarding the coronavirus epidemic in the foreseeable future, we predict that apple may delay new material adoptions or lower test requirements for components to shorten qualification processes,’ mr kuo wrote.
this, he added, would allow the firm to ‘launch new products in [the second half of 2020] on schedule.’
‘the lower spec will likely hurt the average selling price of materials or components.’",[],2020-01-30T20:13:00.000+02:00,2020-01-31T00:28:45.002+02:00,,0.0,25.0,0.0

there is no one in the white house tasked specifically to oversee a coordinated government-wide response in the event of a pandemic, since the post of senior director for global health security and biothreats on the national security council (nsc) was eliminated last may.

the office was established in 2016 after the outbreak of the ebola virus in africa demonstrated the us government was not set up to move with the speed and decisiveness necessary to react to a really lethal epidemic.
the white house global health “czar” was supposed to coordinate international, national, state and local organisations, public and private, to confront a global epidemic, backed by the direct authority of the president.
after he became national security adviser, john bolton eliminated the office as part of an nsc reorganisation, as he did not see global health issues as a national security priority.
as the first person-to-person transmission of coronavirus in the us was reported, and as evidence emerges that it could be much more contagious than initially thought, health and disaster planning experts argued for contingency preparations for a global outbreak.
“you have to at least now be anticipating and responsibly planning against a sort of pandemic level scenario reaching the us,” jeremy konyndyk, who ran foreign disaster assistance in the obama administration, said.
“the fact that they explicitly dismantled the office in the white house that was tasked with preparing for exactly this kind of a risk is hugely concerning,” said konyndyk, now a senior policy fellow at the center for global development. “both the structure and all the institutional memory is gone now.”
funding has also been cut drastically to the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc), forcing it to reduce or discontinue epidemic-prevention efforts in 39 out of the 49 countries it had been helping. among the countries where cdc efforts were scaled back were haiti, rwanda and the democratic republic of congo as well as china, where the agency provided technical assistance.
in its 2020 budget the trump administration proposed a further 10% cut in cdc funding, equivalent to $750m. it zeroed out funding for epidemiology and laboratory capacity at state and local levels.

funding will also dry up this year for a tiered epidemic response within the us. the system was set up in the aftermath of the ebola scare, and involved identifying patients infected by “special pathogens” in frontline hospitals and their transfer up a chain of specially equipped regional hospitals where they could be safely treated.
after this year’s cuts, 10 advanced treatment facilities will still receive funding, but not the 60 other treatment centres one tier below.
“those assessment and treatment hospitals are kind of wondering where they’re going to get funding to continue these very costly efforts,” said saskia popescu, an infection prevention epidemiologist, at george mason university. “so not only are we creating more vulnerable hospitals, but we’re getting this message across that hospitals, if you want to prepare, you’re kind of on your own.”

while it was not a huge surprise that 2019 was unable to maintain the economic and freight volume momentum seen in 2018, the outlook for 2020 is shaping up to be closer to the latter. that was the word from speakers at this week’s smc3 jumpstart 2020 conference in atlanta.
dr. jeffrey rosenweig, associate professor of finance; director, the robson program for business, public policy, and government, at emory university, said in a presentation that when looking at the united states economy, annual gdp output hovered around 2.5% during the presidential administration’s led by george w. bush and barack obama, which have bee followed by some accelerations, at times, during donald trump’s time in office and were largely spurred on by tax cuts.
but that does not come close to telling the full story, he said.
“the current forecast is that [the economy] will still grow, nobody is forecasting a recession just yet,” he said.“but u.s. gdp may slow down to under 2%.”
while retail sales and consumer confidence remain strong, rosenweig said that manufacturing, a sector that, in some ways, is viewed as a proxy for freight activity, may already be falling into recession in the u.s. and in other major global economies, too.
“it is typical that a country like ours leads the world in technology, technological process…and the same amount of workers can produce more each year as technology advances,” he said. “as the machinery and robots we are using increasingly embodies machine learning, where they learn as they go, then we will get to a world of artificial intelligence, self-driving trucks, as well as robots that are more flexible to change what they are doing maybe on assembly lines.”
rosenweig also touched upon the impact of the coronavirus on the global economy, which has rattled markets and resulted in declines in airline share prices, with china-based airlines reducing capacity to main land china through march.
ben hartford, transportation equity research for robert w. baird & co., explained that looking back at 2019 featured weak volume trends elevated inventories, and excess supply, which all came together to plague industry fundamentals.
“we do see evidence that this current freight cycle should bottom during 2020,” he said. “it is going to be a tough first half of the year. i don’t think trends have bottomed yet…when we talk about trends, it is about growth trends being less bad and improving as we finish out the year.”
in 2019, hartford said that freight volume growth deteriorated across multiple modes, with rail carloads as low as levels seen during the 2015-2016 trough, especially for industrial and intermodal loadings. and it was also the same for ltl weight-per-shipment throughout the year, and airfreight and ocean volumes, too, up against tough annual comparisons to 2018. elevated inventories impacted by weak industrial trends also played a role as well, he said.
“we are looking at uncertainty everyday,” he noted. “when you contract, there are a lot of contradictions in the market. there are a lot of similarities between now and the late 1990s, with weak freight trends and industrial trends and equity markets less muted. changing trade and fiscal policies and political rhetoric stand out as similar comparisons to back then. what is different now is the limitless amount of data we have at our fingertips….makes things now more of a matter of perspective in that people can find anything they want to justify any outlandish statement they want to make. it creates a lot of noise and that noise and business uncertainty can plague future growth and from a business owner or consumer standpoint, it does have a tendency to restrict activity for capital budgets and consumer confidence weakens growth.”
with freight growth rates expected to bottom in 2020 and a tough first half of the year expected and a pending bid season approaching, less bad growth rates are in the forecast for the back half of 2020, with the caveat that industrial activity will play a key role in whether that plays out or not, hartford reiterated.
from a supply standpoint, hartford said truckload supply is expected to continue to leave the market, coupled with stabilizing demand supply reduction is expected to support load factors, utilization rates, and help support pricing growth through 2020.
“consumer demand remains solid, and industrial activity is showing some signs of bottoming,” he said. “the reality is it is a long cycle, a slow growth cycle. the reality is economic cycles don’t die of old age, they tend to be killed by sharp spikes in energy prices or inversions in the yield curve. we are near all-time cycle highs for consumer confidence, though. consumer confidence tends to be the last to give up the ghost immediately before a recession. what triggers that are the sharp spikes in energy prices.” ","['https://www.peerless.omeda.com/sc/r-nlet.do', 'https://peerless.omeda.com/sc/r-nlet.do']",2020-01-31T16:50:00.000+02:00,2020-01-31T17:23:42.000+02:00,,0.0,27.0,0.0

the u.n. health agency defines an international emergency as an “extraordinary event” that constitutes a risk to other countries and requires a coordinated international response.
“this virus has spread at unprecedented scale and speed, with cases passing between people in multiple countries across the world,” said dr. jeremy farrar, director of britain’s welcome trust. “it is also a start reminder of how vulnerable we are to epidemics of infectious diseases known and unknown.”
as scientists race to understand how the virus is spreading among people in china, at least 18 other countries have since reported cases. the united states and south korea on thursday confirmed its first cases of person-to-person spread of the virus.

scientists say transmission of the virus is most likely between people with close contact, like families. but there have been reported instances of people who may have had less exposure to the virus in japan and germany.
the coronavirus has now infected more people in china than were sickened there during the 2002-2003 outbreak of sars. virologists believe it originated at a seafood market in the eastern chinese town of wuhan when someone or a group of people came into contact with wild animals being traded there.
according to the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc), coronaviruses are common in camels, cattle, cats, and bats. person-to-person transmissions are thought to occur when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and other respiratory pathogens spread.
other ways the virus may spread from an infected person to others is through touching or shaking hands, or if a person touches a surface with the virus on it, then touches their mouth, nose, or eyes before washing their hands, the cdc says.
but despite the who’s declaration of emergency, the immediate heal risk to the general american public still remains relatively low.

the coronavirus is expected to hit australian sectors exposed to the chinese market, including tourism, education and retail, the hardest.
investment bank ubs on friday published a report exploring the implications of the virus - which has killed 213 people - that estimated a two-month halt on china package tours could cost australia at least $1 billion in services exports.
in 2003, the report outlined, short-term arrivals from china constituted just seven per cent of australia's total inbound tourism - but this number has since ballooned to roughly 30 per cent.
adding to the potential pain, ubs pointed out that february and march were two of the busiest months for chinese travellers to australia, making up about one quarter of annual arrivals.
the ubs report also said major shopping centre operators like vicinity centres and scentre group could suffer from lower numbers of chinese ""tourist shoppers"".
""reduced chinese tourism will impact foot traffic and disproportionately impact sales in flagship assets, cbd assets and certain dfo (outlet) centres,"" it said.
the coronavirus impact is not likely to continue and sales are likely to pick up again, ubs said.
but if there are bankruptcies of shops during the slow time then it will impact retail occupancy rates. latest articles",[],2020-01-31T04:37:00.000+02:00,2020-01-31T10:20:21.046+02:00,,0.0,10.0,0.0

now ford has another chance to deny the chiefs a championship when he faces them with the san francisco 49ers.
advertisement ford's five-year tenure in kansas city came to a disappointing finish last season in the afc championship game against new england. with the chiefs leading by four points and about a minute to play, ford made the mistake of lining up in the neutral zone.
that proved especially costly when tom brady threw an interception to charvarius ward on the play. but instead of the chiefs running out the clock and celebrating an afc championship, the patriots drove to the go-ahead score and eventually won 37-31 in overtime.
""it's in a compartment of all the bad plays which you have done,"" ford said. ""at the end of the day, it's something that happened. i was on the short end of the stick. i got over it. i got over it and i had to get back to work. that's all i could do.""
dee ford gets traded to san francisco after his afc title game blunder. (tony avelar/ap) instead of getting back to work with the chiefs, ford found a new home. kansas city dealt him to san francisco for a 2020 second-round pick after using the franchise tag on him. the niners rewarded him with a five-year, $85 million contract.
the chiefs replaced ford with frank clark and now the teams will square off for a championship that was so close for kansas city last year.
clark called ford's mistake ""inexcusable"" earlier this postseason, a description ford didn't dispute. but the chiefs don't put all the blame on their former player.
""we came up short last year,"" coach andy reid said. ""it kind of fell on dee, but it wasn't dee at all. it was all of us were 4 inches short. and everybody took that responsibility to heart.""
the niners were the big beneficiaries as ford was a big piece in the team's rebuild that has transformed them from 4-12 to the super bowl in one season.

the niners finished tied for fifth in the league with 48 sacks and sixth with 27 takeaways a year after having only 37 sacks and generating a record-low seven takeaways.
""when you've got a guy like dee ford who possesses the speed he does off the edge, it creates so much space for the guys inside,"" defensive coordinator robert saleh said.
""whenever you've got a guy outside that can create the space where you get a true one-on-one where they can't get a hand on you, there's no makeshift double-team. it just makes everybody on the defensive line better. it kind of unlocks everything. he's a major asset. that's why he's one of the best in football. that's why he was sought after after this last season.""
ford dealt with injuries during the regular season and finished with only 6 1/2 sacks while playing only four snaps over the final six games.

""he's so quick and so fast. it's always a tough matchup. you always hoped he'd go to the other side.""
san francisco's pressure rate jumps from 22.7% when ford isn't on the field to 34.2% when he is playing, according to nfl nextgen stats, a sign of his importance.
the niners figure to move ford around on sunday and they have even used him inside against guards in the playoffs, giving offenses a different look with bosa and ford lined up next to each other.
""i like to think offensive linemen, they're creatures of habit, so when they see the same guy over and over and over again, they can really get comfortable in knowing how to set against a certain person,"" defensive tackle deforest buckner said.

the world health organization on thursday declared the outbreak a “public health emergency of international concern.”
there are three confirmed cases in canada and all are linked to recent travel in china.
travel agencies in china have been told to halt all group tours, the state-owned china daily newspaper reported, citing the china association of travel services.
travel alberta, which works to promote tourism to the province, said it is hearing about cancellations from tour operators and hotels.
“we have not had mass waves of cancellations,” ceo royce chwin said in an interview. “we’ve had some cancellations — although i don’t have a qualified number.”
the cancellations include group tours to jasper and banff in the rocky mountains, he said.
banff lake louise tourism said in a statement that it has seen a minimal impact so far, but noted that staff are monitoring the situation.
“it’s early days so (we) can’t fully anticipate the impact,” said angela anderson, director of communications. “we are encouraging all businesses in our destination to help make any changes or cancellations as easy as possible and penalty-free.
“china is an important market for us, so we are hopeful the situation gets under control as soon as possible.”
travel alberta is also pausing its consumer marketing activities in china.
hysan lee, owner and operator of aurora holiday tours in yellowknife, said he’s had about 200 cancellations in the last few weeks.
“this morning, i got five emails,” he said thursday.
the company books tours and hotels for chinese people travelling to the northwest territories.
lee said he’s offering a full refund for the cancellations, which were mostly for february and march.
discover banff tours declined to comment and other tour companies in b.c. and alberta didn’t respond to requests for interviews.
travel alberta’s chwin said he hasn’t heard about any operators or hotels that are overly worried.
“everybody is just being proactive and has general concern, obviously, for the general well-being of people first and secondly how it might impact the business,” he said. “we’re just seeing a bit of trickle here.”
the impact, he said, is nowhere near what it was in 2003 when sars, a viral respiratory illness also caused by a coronavirus, hit toronto.
“sars was centred in canada where this is not,” said chwin. “canada is not the focus of attention. it really did hurt the industry back in the day when sars happened, while this (new coronavirus) is centred in china.
“it’s not really a relevant comparison.”

hospital management, so said, told him that he would not need to isolate himself, because he had been in protective gear when dealing with the patients. so found this decision “bizarre,” because there was no way of ruling out any chance of contamination. returning to work as usual, he thought, would only put other patients and colleagues at risk. that’s how so decided to check himself into a hotel room for at least two weeks, paying out of his own pocket for accommodation. though management later told him that the hospital can make available 21 isolation rooms on site for medical personnel, he felt that this would still be insufficient in the event of a full-blown outbreak in hong kong. “i would say the hospital authority has been quite slow in responding to this outbreak and they haven’t had clear contingency plans…it shows how limited our resources are,” said so, referring to the government body that manages the city’s hospitals. “if a full community outbreak does happen there’s no way our medical system can deal with that.” https://twitter.com/viviennechow/status/1220590555626762241?s=20 now he’s spending his time in isolation, drafting statements and petitions calling for a medical strike. more than 6,500 nurses and doctors have already pledged to strike unless the government meets their demands, foremost of which is the complete closure of all 14 border control points with mainland china in order to stem the coronavirus outbreak. on tuesday (jan. 28), hong kong chief executive carrie lam ordered a partial closure of the border , but the measure was widely panned as ineffective because only about 10% of mainland chinese visitors come through the ports of entry being shut. to many, the hong kong government appears unable to make its own decisions without first deferring to beijing. when lam announced travel restrictions for mainland chinese visitors this week, it was presented not as hong kong barring entry to mainlanders, but as china suspending the issuance of individual tourist visas. when the chief secretary addressed concerns about the shortage of surgical masks, he said he had asked china to allow imports of masks into hong kong. and with the government’s continued refusal to close the border with china despite polling showing overwhelming public support for the measure, people are again wondering whether officials truly have the public’s interests at heart. lam doubled down on her decision at another news conference today, arguing that measures to close the border would “ stigmatize ” mainland chinese. “no one is asking for the border to be closed permanently,” so said. “what we’re asking for is in the interim… there’s a need to very firmly tighten up border controls so that we can limit the number of further imported cases.” and while the government has already banned entry to hong kong for people from hubei province, the outbreak’s epicenter, so says this is “nowhere near enough” as the coronavirus has already spread throughout china. https://twitter.com/leungkaichihk/status/1223198938494193664 already, some 90 nurses at three hospitals called in sick earlier this week to sound the alarm ahead of the strike.“they were very concerned about the quality of our facilities and that they wouldn’t be able to protect themselves or our patients,” he said of the nurses. but he also understands that calling for medical professionals to strike can be morally fraught. the hong kong public doctors’ association, for one, has said it would not take part in the strike . the hospital authority employees’ alliance, a newly formed union that grew out of the protest movement and that is organizing the industrial action, will vote tomorrow on whether to go on strike . the continuing resistance movement , so said, has galvanized support for protest actions like strikes. “the incentive for health care workers to go on strike is very low, there’s a lot of moral baggage we’re carrying,” so said. “but if this is the only way to force the government to take real policy action, then this is what we have to do.” he said that friends and family are also supportive of the strike because “they understand this is the last resort to force the government to take action to stop the outbreak from happening.”",[],2020-01-31T02:00:00.000+02:00,2020-01-31T13:01:26.000+02:00,,0.0,33.0,0.0

the firm stated that drivers had bravely agreed to take the job - although it's unsure if they will also face being quarantined.
six coach drivers will be given 10 days off work.
bosses at horseman coaches also said each vehicle will be given a special deep clean and explained how they persuaded staff to take up the job.
medics wearing hazmat suits were sat in the front seats but the drivers appeared to have little or no protection gear.
it comes after the world health organisation yesterday (january 30) declared a global health emergency as the death toll hit 170, and the first two cases in the uk were confirmed this morning, with two members of the same family testing positive for coronavirus.
health officials are urgently trying to trace those who came into contact with these two people.

chinese health officials said on friday morning that the death toll in the country from the virus had risen to 213, with the number of known cases rising from 7,711 to 9,962.
no deaths have occurred outside china, although cases have been confirmed across at least 23 countries.
the number of coronavirus cases worldwide has surpassed that of the sars epidemic, although death rates are lower.
many other countries, including australia, south korea, singapore and new zealand, have said they plan to quarantine evacuees for two weeks to avoid spread of the virus. like us on facebook","['https://communicator-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/getreading/subscriptions/&quot;}', 'https://www.communicator-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/getreading/subscriptions/&quot;}']",2020-01-31T19:46:00.000+02:00,2020-01-31T23:43:27.035+02:00,,0.0,23.0,0.0

the s&p 500 on friday fell 1.45%, with the dow and nasdaq also sharply down on the day. not exactly an auspicious start to the weekend.
with earnings multiples at relatively high levels and an economy late in its expansion, strategists have been looking for a drawdown in stocks, even if the bull market then continues. the u.s. economy is sustaining a roughly 2% growth clip, with the federal reserve’s hand gently resting on the down lever for interest rates.
with stocks now falling, investors might be facing a buying opportunity.
the s&p 500 is down 3% from its recent all-time high, as the coronavirus threatens growth in the chinese economy and therefore u.s. companies that operate in asia.
many strategists say that if the coronavirus turns out anything like the 2003 sars outbreak, the market will rebound, in part because the disease would be eradicated.
ubs’s chief investment officer of global wealth management, mark haefele, said on monday that while the firm remains “alert for a further increase in its severity, we expect the outbreak’s impact on the region’s economy and risk assets to be short-lived , in part based on evidence from the past.""
the phrase most used by several strategists in their market comments monday was “buying opportunity.”
starbucks sbux closed half its stores in china , as consumers stay home. american air, aal delta dal and united airlines ual on friday canceled flights to china after the world health organization declared the virus a global emergency. those four stocks in the past five days have shed 4%, add american here, 1.2% and 3.75%, respectively.
if 2020 earnings estimates come down and the virus is then wiped away within a few months, 2021 revenue and earnings estimates will likely be unchanged, creating the potential for easier earnings comparisons with 2020.
“this is going to cause a hiccup in 2020 — this is a good time for long-term investors to find opportunity,” shawn cruz, trading-strategy manager at td ameritrade, told thestreet.
still, patient buying is warranted. “we&apos;re going to have some chop [volatility] in the next few weeks while we find out what’s happening,” jim carney, founder and ceo of purples partners, told thestreet.
google earnings
google googl reports earnings on feb. 3. analysts are looking for revenue of $46.9 billion and earnings per share of $12.49.
rbc capital markets analyst mark mahaney says google might come up a bit short on revenue but exceed estimates on earnings. “facebook read through: incrementally negative, given potential advertising targeting headwinds created by recent regulatory changes,” he said.
but the bottom line going forward could have a savior.
“google bought back $12.3 billion in [stock] in q1 to q3 [2019] and we are intrigued by the possibility that [parent] alphabet could materially increase its share repurchase in fiscal year 2020,” mahaney said.

they sit for countless hours. some take neat, handwritten notes in blue ink, like elizabeth warren. cory gardner has an omnipresent pad of post-its on his desk for small-scale scribbling. others, like republican richard shelby of alabama, watch proceedings quietly and impassively for hours at time. but whatever their process, all 100 senators must determine how to weigh the evidence presented for and against the conviction of donald trump.
oregon democrat jeff merkley told intelligencer that he had already taken over 50 pages of notes. he remarked that he might have taken more but the “piles of handouts” from house managers have reduced the number that he needed to take. he planned on going through all of his notes in “a systematic process” during the 16 hours allotted for senators to ask questions.
merkley, a devoted player of kenken puzzles, said that he was “more of a math guy than words guy” and planned to lay out a system to weigh the key points of each article of impeachment. the two-term senator from oregon then said he would structure the information “so on each of those key points, what is the evidence that is brought to bear both for and against? so kind of one setup for and against.”
battling a bad cold, merkley said he felt “very depleted” as a result of the long hours of the trial despite being “normally being very high-energy during the day.” to cope with this, he said, “i’m doing a fair amount of standing and i’m getting glasses of ice cubes. so i’m crunching on ice cubes.” merkley also said that he kept “little pieces of beef jerky” in his desk drawer. the oregon democrat compared the ordeal to being on a long road trip. “this is what i do when i drive,” he said. “when i’m on a drive and if i’m tired, i try to have something to sip or to nibble on. it somehow just helps me. here, in this case, it’s ice cubes and standing. “
a non-lawyer, merkley does have experience as juror. he served on a jury in d.c. before moving back to oregon and seeking elected office. in the senate, this was merkley’s second impeachment, his first being the 2010 trial of federal judge thomas porteous, who was convicted of corruption and removed from office. merkley noted that experience was “completely different — there was no partisanship. when we locked the doors and talked to each other in preparation, it was just like 100 senators with no party identity.”
in contrast, kamala harris, a former prosecutor, harkened back to her legal career. “i’m thinking of it in terms of the elements of the case,” and used a familiar law school approach of irac — issue, rule, application and conclusion — to organize her thinking about the case. harris was able to sit back and appreciate the approach of the house managers from a technical standpoint. “they are doing it in a very logical way,” said the former california state attorney general. “i know the method that they are using. i appreciate it and i admire it.”
despite her courtroom experience, harris had never sat on a jury before, so the experience is new. she described herself as an “active listener” who was “not so good sitting down for long periods” and said that she was taking an “average” amount of notes compared to her colleagues.
another senator with a legal background, republican josh hawley of missouri, told intelligencer, “i’ve now been through all the briefs and responsive briefs several times.” the former law clerk for chief justice john roberts said, “if you watch my desk, you’ll see staff coming because i’m requesting articles. i continue to read about impeachment, about precedent, about interpretative questions. i’ve read a lot of the cases under american law on bribery and extortion because that clearly is the democrats’ case, what the elements are for that.“ hawley added, “by the way, i’m confident after that [research] there simply is no legal case for bribery and extortion there, just zero.”
hawley did say that he had been enjoying the trial. “it’s kind of fun,” said the missouri republican. “i love being a lawyer and i miss the practice of law, so this kind of exciting.” he mused, “it’s the closest i’ll ever get to being a judge, i’m sure.” but hawley didn’t need the fun to go on too much longer. “hopefully it won’t go on for six months.”

thursday, jan. 30, 2020 (healthday news) -- the world health organization declared the wuhan coronavirus outbreak an international public health emergency on thursday, as the united states reported its first case of person-to-person transmission of the virus.
the declaration states that the world's top health advisory body thinks the situation is grave, the new york times reported. countries can then make their own decisions about closing their borders, canceling flights, screening people arriving at airports or taking other protective measures.
in the united states, the latest coronavirus patient is the husband of a chicago woman who was the second confirmed case in the united states. she had traveled to wuhan , china, the epicenter of the outbreak, and fell ill upon her return home. the husband is in his 60s and has underlying health conditions, u.s. health officials said during a media briefing thursday. six cases of coronavirus have now been reported in the united states.
""this second patient [the husband] did not travel to china, indicating the first person-to-person transmission of novel coronavirus in the united states,"" said dr. ngozi ezike, director of the illinois department of public health.
""the risk to the general public in illinois remains low,"" ezike said during the briefing. ""this person-to-person spread was between two very close contacts, a wife and husband. the virus is not spreading widely across the community.""
dr. robert redfield, director of the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention , agreed.
""we understand this may be concerning, but based on what we know now our assessment remains that the risk to the public is low,"" redfield said during the briefing.
""the vast majority of americans have not had recent travel to china, the high-risk areas of transmission where human-to-human transmission is occurring,"" he added.
u.s. health experts said person-to-person transmission in the united states was inevitable.
""the main takeaway is this confirms something we already knew: that there was likely person-to-person spread in china with this virus. otherwise the numbers wouldn't be as high as they are,"" said dr. eric cioe-pena, director of global health at northwell health in new hyde park, n.y.
in china, the case count kept climbing on thursday, with cases of what is dubbed the 2019-ncov coronavirus now reaching 8,149. the death total stands at 171, the times reported. those counts eclipse the 5,327 cases and 348 deaths reported in china during the 2003 sars outbreak.
meanwhile, countries around the world took steps to cut the risk of the virus spreading to their citizens.
in the united states, health officials explained on wednesday what measures are being taken to make sure the americans who were evacuated from wuhan on tuesday are not infected with the new virus.
while none of the 195 american evacuees have shown signs of sickness, they agreed to stay at the base voluntarily, said dr. chris braden, of the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention . the plan is to hold them for three days and check them for fever and other symptoms at least twice daily, cnn reported.
""they wanted to protect their family. they wanted to protect others,"" braden said.
the trump administration also announced on wednesday that it had formed a coronavirus task force to monitor and manage the united states' response to the outbreak. members of the task force have met every day this week, and president donald trump chaired the meeting on wednesday, u.s. health officials said.
managing the public health situation in china is far more challenging.
after first declining assistance from international health officials, chinese authorities agreed to let expert teams coordinated by the world health organization visit china to help stem the outbreak, the times reported wednesday.
chinese health officials have determined that people carrying the virus but not showing symptoms can still infect others. the incubation period can vary from one to 14 days, with a typical duration of about 10 days. that fact makes containment especially difficult. this was not the case with the sars coronavirus outbreak.
still, china's efforts to try to contain the outbreak continue, including a travel ban that involves more than 50 million people.
meanwhile, hong kong has barred entry to visitors from hubei province, which is at the center of the outbreak, and travel agencies were ordered to cancel group tours nationwide. airlines around the world suspended flights to china on wednesday, and russia closed its 2,600-mile border with china, the times reported.
outside china, numerous countries have reported cases of coronavirus.
thailand has reported 14 cases of infection; japan has 11; hong kong and singapore have 10; taiwan has eight; australia, malaysia and macau each have seven; france has five; south korea, germany and the united arab emirates each have 4; canada has three; vietnam has two; and india, the philippines, nepal, cambodia, sri lanka and finland each have one.","['https://facebook.com/2008/fbml', 'https://www.facebook.com/2008/fbml']",2020-01-31T09:00:00.000+02:00,2020-01-31T09:06:32.027+02:00,,0.0,39.0,0.0

new delhi (reuters) - india's government predicted that economic growth will pick up to between 6% and 6.5% in the fiscal year beginning april 1, after falling to more than a decade-low this financial year.
india saw growth drop to 4.5% in the july-september quarter - its lowest level in 26 quarters. consequently, the budget deficit for the upcoming fiscal year may need to exceed this year's target of 3.3% of gross domestic product, the government said in an economic survey released on friday.
india should rationalize food subsidies, push exports and adopt counter-cyclical fiscal policy to boost sluggish demand, krishnamurthy subramanian, chief economic adviser to the finance ministry, said in the report.
but he warned that expanding fiscal deficit targets would pose a risk of ""crowding out private investments"" and slower growth in consumer demand amid continued global trade tensions.
the government estimates gross domestic product will grow 5% this fiscal year, which ends on march 31. that would be the slowest growth since the global financial crisis of 2008-09.
the survey urged the government to use its majority in parliament to speed reforms to boost investments and recovery.

some economists believe the survey's growth forecast is too optimistic. they point out recovery remains fragile, inflation is accelerating, and consumer demand and investments are likely to decline, even though the central bank cut interest rates by 135 basis points in 2019.
""the forecast could be aspirational,"" said n.r bhanumurthy, at the national institute of public finance and policy think tank.
""there are difficult times we are facing right now, the economy is in a bad shape,"" he added, citing protests against the new citizenship law, perceived to be discriminatory to muslims.
""thali-nomics""
in an attempt to show the impact of the fall in overall inflation during the last six years with narendra modi as prime minister, the survey came up with the term ""thalinomics - the economics of a plate of food in india.""
the survey said affordability of vegetarian ""thalis"", a hindi word for a plate of food, has improved by 29% from 2006-07 to 2019-2020, and non-vegetarian ""thalis"" by 18%.
the modi government has touted its achievement in bringing down inflation from a 12.13% high in november 2013 to below 5%, though it has risen again and recorded a five-year high of 7.35% in december.
the survey said the fall in food inflation has been a major contributing factor in reductions between 2014-15, when the modi government first came to power, and 2018-19.
however, economists point out that low core inflation, without fuel and food prices, is evidence for weak demand in the economy.
finance minister nirmala sitharaman will present the budget for the coming fiscal year on saturday.
in it, sitharaman is expected to announce a host of economy-reviving measures. income tax cuts, higher spending on infrastructure and incentives for real estate are likely. so is a plan to revive stressed shadow banks.
however, the slowdown in growth has reduced tax revenues. the government may be forced to channel its increased spending through quasi-sovereign bodies, which would not be included in its deficit calculations.
the report gave no projection for the deficit. economists believe that is around 3.8% for the ongoing fiscal year.
to accommodate higher spending, the deficit might be allowed to grow to at least 3.5%, missing the 3% target for next year, sources and economists have told reuters.
subramanian also said that the impact of china's fast-spreading coronavirus would be marginal on the indian economy.

the median enterprise value to sales metric offers a very good picture of the magnitude of the stock market bubble. enterprise value [investopedia] for a company is calculated by adding market cap and debt and subtracting cash and equivalents. median ev to sales is a more accurate valuation metric because it accounts for company debt.

crescat capital’s otavio costa warns that the coronavirus is just the tip of the iceberg. he told ccn that china’s credit imbalances can affect u.s. equities:
china is dealing with a $40 trillion banking system facing significant deceleration of gdp growth, rising inflationary forces, and a declining current account problem. the likelihood of a debt crisis in china would be largely contagious to the global economy and could severely impact us markets at the late stages of its business cycle.
crescat capital may be right: the bear case may be stronger than ever. other analysts not yet pushing the panic button
while there’s a divergence between fundamentals and price, many analysts remain bullish on the u.s. stock market. jm vala, co-founder of layup trades, is a steadfast bull. he says that dips are opportunities to enter the market at a discount . he told ccn,
the trend is bullish. it has been bullish, and will be bullish until the end of the business cycle. all pullbacks are opportunities to add or create new longs, and that’s how all dips should be treated until volume nodes no longer are supportive of price.
when asked for key levels to watch out for, the trader replied,
for the market to move higher, we will need to see spy hold above 329, which is the 61.8% retracement of the pullback. so long as the market continues to hold 320-322, then we will continue to have violent pullbacks and major expansions higher.
if we’re basing the market purely off technical indicators, valuations don’t seem to matter presently. however, we are already getting signals that valuations will matter soon. when that time comes, we may see the s&p 500 plunge like never before.

new delhi [india], jan 31 (ani): bank credit growth (yoy) moderated from 12.9 per cent in april 2019 to 7.1 per cent as on december 20, 2019, says the economic survey tabled in parliament by finance and corporate affairs minister nirmala sitharaman.
according to the survey, the financial flows to the economy remained constrained as credit growth declined for both banks and non-banking financial companies (nbfcs.)the capital to risk-weighted asset ratio of scheduled commercial banks (scbs) increased from 14.3 per cent to 15.1 per cent between march 2019 and september 2019.
after significant decline since 2014-15, india's external liabilities (debt and equity) to gross domestic product (gdp) increased at the end of june 2019 primarily by an increase in fdi, portfolio flows and external commercial borrowings (ecbs), notes the survey.
repo rate was cut by 110 basis points in four consecutive mpc meetings in the financial year due to slower growth and lower inflation. it was, however, kept unchanged in the fifth meeting held in december 2019.
in 2019-20, liquidity conditions were tight for the initial two months; but subsequently, it remained comfortable.
gross non-performing advances ratio remained unchanged for scbs at 9.3 per cent between march and september 2019 but increased slightly for nbfcs from 6.1 per cent in march 2019 to 6.3 per cent in september 2019.
public sector banks (psbs) with about 70 per cent of the market share in indian banking have an onus of supporting the indian economy and fostering its economic development.
the survey observes that there is disproportionate dwarfism of the indian banks when compared to the size of the indian economy. for india to march in its goal of becoming a $5trillion economy, psbs - the dominant banks in our banking system - need to become efficient.
the economy needs psbs to perform to their fullest potential and support economic growth rather than pullback lending, which has a detrimental effect on growth and welfare.
the survey expresses that if indian banks were proportionately large in relation to the size of the indian economy, india should have at least six banks in the global top 100 than just the current largest psb- state bank of india (sbi)-which is the 55th largest bank globally.
the survey notes that despite nationalisation a significant portion of the poor remained unbanked till 2014. financial inclusion, in large part, happened in august 2014 through the pradhan mantri jan dhan yojana (pmjdy), the first week of which saw more than 18 million bank accounts - a record in the guinness book of world records.
the economic survey notes that the growth in digital transactions has been significant. the use of direct benefit transfers has increased exponentially over the last five years, has helped to bring both credit and deposits into the banking system across all geographies (rural, semi-urban, urban and metropolitan).
the high elasticity across all geographies clearly demonstrates the opportunity that exists for indian banks to benefit from the greater use of dbt by the government. there are possibilities for the indian banking sector to grow proportionate to the scale of the indian economy. the new programmes have resulted in a surge of individuals and businesses being brought into the formal economy.
the economic survey also observes that over rs 4,30,000 crore of taxpayer money is invested as the government's equity in psbs. in 2019, every rupee of taxpayer money is invested in psbs, on average, lost 23 paise. the state of the banking sector in india, therefore, needs urgent attention.

new delhi [india], jan 31 (ani): bank credit growth (yoy) moderated from 12.9 per cent in april 2019 to 7.1 per cent as on december 20, 2019, says the economic survey tabled in parliament by finance and corporate affairs minister nirmala sitharaman.
according to the survey, the financial flows to the economy remained constrained as credit growth declined for both banks and non-banking financial companies (nbfcs.)the capital to risk-weighted asset ratio of scheduled commercial banks (scbs) increased from 14.3 per cent to 15.1 per cent between march 2019 and september 2019.
after significant decline since 2014-15, india's external liabilities (debt and equity) to gross domestic product (gdp) increased at the end of june 2019 primarily by an increase in fdi, portfolio flows and external commercial borrowings (ecbs), notes the survey.
repo rate was cut by 110 basis points in four consecutive mpc meetings in the financial year due to slower growth and lower inflation. it was, however, kept unchanged in the fifth meeting held in december 2019.
in 2019-20, liquidity conditions were tight for the initial two months; but subsequently, it remained comfortable.
gross non-performing advances ratio remained unchanged for scbs at 9.3 per cent between march and september 2019 but increased slightly for nbfcs from 6.1 per cent in march 2019 to 6.3 per cent in september 2019.
public sector banks (psbs) with about 70 per cent of the market share in indian banking have an onus of supporting the indian economy and fostering its economic development.
the survey observes that there is disproportionate dwarfism of the indian banks when compared to the size of the indian economy. for india to march in its goal of becoming a $5trillion economy, psbs - the dominant banks in our banking system - need to become efficient.
the economy needs psbs to perform to their fullest potential and support economic growth rather than pullback lending, which has a detrimental effect on growth and welfare.

spoofing matthew leising – bloomberg it’s a new crime but it isn’t new. it has a silly name but it’s no joke. spoofing, a way to manipulate financial markets for illegitimate profit, is blamed for undermining the integrity of trading and contributing to the scariest crash since the financial crisis. spoofers trick other investors into buying or selling by entering their own buy or sell orders with no intention of filling them. that creates fake demand that pushes prices up or down. long considered disreputable but rarely dangerous, spoofing has emerged in an era of computerized trading as a threat to market legitimacy. regulators, lawmakers and market authorities are struggling to define and control it.

boston (ap) — a harvard university professor charged with lying about his role in a chinese talent recruitment program was released from custody thursday and ordered to post a $1 million cash bond.
charles lieber appeared in boston&apos;s federal court wearing orange jail garb and chains around his ankles two days after his arrest at his ivy league university office, where he was chair of the chemistry and chemical biology department.
lieber is accused of lying about his participation in china&apos;s thousand talents plan, which targets overseas scientists and researchers willing to bring their expertise to china in exchange for things like research funding and lab space.
prosecutors had proposed setting bond at $1.5 million secured by lieber&apos;s suburban boston home. but magistrate judge marianne bowler instead ordered lieber to post a $1 million cash bond by next thursday.
lieber did not comment as he left the courthouse with his wife amid a throng of reporters after the hearing. his lawyers also declined to comment.
lieber is required to give up his passport and disclose any foreign bank accounts and is barred from talking to any potential victims or witnesses in the case, among other restrictions. his wife will also hand over her passport after prosecutors raised concerns that she could move cash to another country.
prosecutors say lieber agreed to conduct research, publish articles and apply for patents on behalf of china&apos;s wuhan university of technology in exchange for $50,000 per month and about $150,000 in living expenses. he also received $1.5 million to establish a research lab at the chinese university, authorities said.
authorities say lieber hid his involvement in the program from harvard and told federal investigators in 2018 that he had never been asked to participate in the program.
harvard officials said tuesday that lieber has been placed on administrative leave and that the school is “conducting its own review of the alleged misconduct.”
lieber has been at harvard since 1991 and is described by his research group as a “pioneer in nanoscience and nanotechnology.” he has also won prizes for growing huge pumpkins in the backyard of his lexington home, including a 1870-pound (850-kilogram) pumpkin in 2014, abc news reported at the time.
lieber&apos;s arrest highlights the federal government&apos;s growing concern over china&apos;s efforts to steal u.s. research and technology.
chinese recruitment programs such as the thousand talents plan have been exploited by scientists who have downloaded sensitive research files before returning to china, filed patents based on u.s. research, lied on grant applications and failed to disclose money they had received from chinese institutions, according to a congressional report issued last fall .
federal prosecutors in boston also announced charges this week against a researcher at boston university, who is accused of concealing her ties to the chinese military. yanqing ye, who prosecutors say is a lieutenant in the people’s liberation army, lied about her military service to get into the u.s. and researched u.s. military projects and gathered information on two u.s. scientists for the chinese military, authorities allege.
the fbi on thursday released a wanted poster for ye , who is believed to be in china.","['http://ap.org/', 'http://www.ap.org', 'https://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/meet-massachusetts-man-winning-1870-pound-pumpkin/story?id=26163871', 'https://www.apnews.com/73fa72b776f2403688a572b770d7f3b5', 'https://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/meet-massachusetts-man-winning-1870-pound-pumpkin/story', 'https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/counterintelligence/yanqing-ye', 'https://apnews.com/90af50ee87d5679d51177210f763e153', 'https://fbi.gov/wanted/counterintelligence/yanqing-ye', 'https://www.abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/meet-massachusetts-man-winning-1870-pound-pumpkin/story?id=26163871', 'https://apnews.com/73fa72b776f2403688a572b770d7f3b5', 'https://www.apnews.com/90af50ee87d5679d51177210f763e153', 'http://www.ap.org/']",2020-01-31T01:16:00.000+02:00,2020-01-31T04:49:04.003+02:00,,0.0,18.0,0.0

london/singapore (reuters) - oil prices rose on friday but were still set for a fourth consecutive weekly loss, as markets attempted to assess the economic damage of the coronavirus that has spread from china to around 20 countries, killing more than 200 people.
brent crude was 31 cents higher at $58.60 a barrel by 0943 gmt but was still down 3.4% on the week.
u.s. west texas intermediate (wti) rose by 34 cents to $52.48 a barrel. it is 3.2% lower on the week.
both benchmarks rose by more than $1 earlier in the session.
the who said late thursday that the coronavirus outbreak was a global emergency, but calmed the markets by opposing travel restrictions. it said chinese actions so far will ""reverse the tide"" of its spread.
""china’s better-than-expected expansion in its january non-manufacturing pmi, along with the concerted efforts by the authorities to contain the viral outbreak, could help push back against some of the fears surrounding the epidemic’s impact on the world’s second-largest economy,"" said han tan, market analyst at fxtm.
oil prices were also buoyed by reports that saudi arabia has opened a discussion about moving an upcoming policy meeting to early february from march to address the impact of coronavirus on crude demand.
energy consultancy wood mackenzie lowered its estimate for world oil demand by 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) for the first quarter of 2020, according to its consultant yujiao lei, saying china’s oil demand for the same period could also be reduced by more than 250,000 bpd.
""although the chinese government has been taking action more swiftly in a more determined manner than in 2003 (during the sars outbreak), chinese domestic and international transport activity is incomparably higher today and thus the impact may be larger,"" lei added.
china's new year holiday was due to end on friday, when many companies planned to get back to work after a week-long vacation, but authorities have ordered businesses in many areas to stay shut longer in a bid to contain the disease.
widespread travel restrictions, meanwhile, mean millions of migrant workers may be unable to return to what has often been called the world's factory floor.
a growing number of airlines are suspending flights to china to halt the spread of the virus.
brexit day, which comes three and a half years after the united kingdom first voted to leave the european union, is not expected to move markets, analysts said.

the coronavirus epidemic is a clear cause for concern throughout the planet. despite the fact that it belongs to a fairly large family of viruses (ranging from the common flu to the new chinese 2019-ncov) and that there are numerous examples of viruses that can be transmitted from animals to humans, it is rare that the virus then manages to mutate to transmit itself from a person to another.
this has been the main cause for concern: that it might be transmitted between humans. after several reported cases of human-to-human transmission (including in the united states), the world health organization has declared a state of global emergency .
according to the latest daily report from the world health organization (january 30) , to date there are 7,818 confirmed cases of contagion globally, of which 7,736 are in china, where 1,370 people are severely ill and 170 have died. there are also 12,167 more suspected but unconfirmed cases. outside china, there are 82 confirmed cases in 18 countries.
the current epidemic of coronaviruses is similar to two others: sars in 2002 (also originated in china, in the province of canton) and mers in 2012 (which originated in saudi arabia). both are forms of coronavirus that lead to severe respiratory syndromes and have been characterized by rapid transmission and high mortality. sars, like 2019-ncov, was a virus that originated in animals (it may have been in bats in both cases) that were then transmitted to humans.
however, since sars in 2002, many things have changed for the better.
the who has praised the measures taken by china to contain the outbreak. since 2002, china has strengthened its health system. contrary to what happened at the time, china quickly made the existence of the virus public, chinese scientists identified its genetic sequence and published it in a matter of days, allowing groups of scientists around the world to work collaboratively on developing a vaccine , a diagnostic protocol, collaborative mechanisms between reference laboratories, and several other strategies to understand the spread of the disease.
johns hopkins university , for example, developed a tool for real-time mapping of coronavirus spread .
in addition, the chinese government has taken unprecedented steps to contain the disease, quarantining more than 30 million people; a step that, as the new york times mentions, no american politician would have been able to take . and the construction in record time of a hospital for the treatment of those infected.
on a global level, the hardening of the health measures has been remarkable, in some cases closing borders , at least partially. latin america
in the midst of this context, latin america has some characteristics that act as protective factors. the first, and most obvious, is distance: not only are we separated by an enormous geographical distance, but direct flights between china and latin america are very rare.
mexico had a direct flight passing through tijuana, which has been cancelled .
this necessarily means that those who arrive in latin america after having been in china will have to go through controls at other international airports.
people who are found to have coronavirus-like symptoms, such as fever, for example, will most likely be placed in quarantine.
still, as mexican undersecretary of prevention and health promotion hugo lópez-gatell ramírez has stated, it is very difficult to contain the disease (due to its own epidemic characteristic), so it is highly probable that sooner or later it will arrive.
however, it is important to take into account the following factors: one, 2019-ncov seems to be less transmissible and less lethal and two, latin american laboratories have the capacity to detect it.
while the current coronavirus outbreak has had a mortality rate of 2-4%, its cousins had a much higher mortality rate: 15-20% for sars and 65% for mers.
with regard to latin america's ability to detect infection in a timely manner, authorities have been confident: marcos espinal, director of the pan american health organization's department of communicable diseases and health analysis, told cnn en español that most latin american countries have sufficiently well equipped laboratories.
""these are routine technologies in any laboratory for diagnosing bacteria or viruses,"" isabel sola, the co-director of the coronavirus laboratory at the national center for biotechnology in spain, told dw .
in several latin american countries, including brazil, ecuador , mexico, colombia and peru , travelers suspected of being infected have been tested, but so far there have been no confirmed cases.
argentina, bolivia, brazil, chile, colombia, costa rica, ecuador, el salvador, guatemala, mexico, panama, paraguay, peru, nicaragua and uruguay have taken steps to tighten their health and safety controls.
while it took the world health organization several days to decree a global state of emergency because the countries where there have been declared cases so far have sufficient economic and technological development to deal with them, it is now focusing on strengthening the security and response capacity of the least developed and therefore most vulnerable countries. an important part of this effort is being concentrated on africa . tags","['https://devex.com/news/africa-needs-early-detection-of-coronavirus-who-says-96460', 'http://youtube.com/watch?v=5h06W8xBgMY', 'https://jpost.com/International/With-Wuhan-coronavirus-genetic-code-cracked-scientists-begin-work-on-a-vaccine-615518', 'https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/28-01-2020-who-china-leaders-discuss-next-steps-in-battle-against-coronavirus-outbreak', 'https://who.int/news-room/detail/28-01-2020-who-china-leaders-discuss-next-steps-in-battle-against-coronavirus-outbreak', 'https://www.jpost.com/International/With-Wuhan-coronavirus-genetic-code-cracked-scientists-begin-work-on-a-vaccine-615518', 'https://nytimes.com/2020/01/30/world/asia/coronavirus-china.html', 'https://www.elespectador.com/noticias/salud/en-tiempo-record-china-construira-un-hospital-para-infectados-con-el-coronavirus-articulo-901376', 'https://elespectador.com/noticias/salud/en-tiempo-record-china-construira-un-hospital-para-infectados-con-el-coronavirus-articulo-901376', 'https://www.cnnespanol.cnn.com/video/coronavirus-marcos-espinal-entrevista-fernando-del-rincon-conclusiones/', 'https://elespectador.com/noticias/salud/asi-se-prepara-america-latina-en-caso-de-que-se-confirme-presencia-del-coronavirus-articulo-901808', 'https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200130-sitrep-10-ncov.pdf', 'https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/video/coronavirus-marcos-espinal-entrevista-fernando-del-rincon-conclusiones/', 'https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6', 'https://who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200130-sitrep-10-ncov.pdf?sfvrsn=d0b2e480_2', 'https://www.elimparcial.com/mexico/Mexico-cancela-vuelos-directos-desde-China-al-aeropuerto-de-Tijuana-20200128-0014.html', 'https://systems.jhu.edu/research/public-health/ncov/', 'https://www.systems.jhu.edu/research/public-health/ncov/', 'https://www.elespectador.com/noticias/salud/asi-se-prepara-america-latina-en-caso-de-que-se-confirme-presencia-del-coronavirus-articulo-901808', 'http://www.youtube.com/watch', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/30/world/asia/coronavirus-china.html', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/30/health/coronavirus-world-health-organization.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage', 'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h06W8xBgMY', 'https://www.gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6', 'https://www.devex.com/news/africa-needs-early-detection-of-coronavirus-who-says-96460', 'https://nytimes.com/2020/01/30/health/coronavirus-world-health-organization.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage', 'https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/video/coronavirus-marcos-espinal-entrevista-fernando-del-rincon-conclusiones', 'https://systems.jhu.edu/research/public-health/ncov', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/30/health/coronavirus-world-health-organization.html', 'https://elimparcial.com/mexico/Mexico-cancela-vuelos-directos-desde-China-al-aeropuerto-de-Tijuana-20200128-0014.html', 'https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200130-sitrep-10-ncov.pdf?sfvrsn=d0b2e480_2']",2020-01-31T00:23:00.000+02:00,2020-01-31T02:35:10.003+02:00,,0.0,34.0,0.0

by alfred pagepitu
the ministry of health and medical services (mhms) has reportedly requested a temporary travel ban on incoming travellers from wuhan or china.
the million dollar question is whether government will endorse this.
senior officials within the health ministry, speaking to island sun in anonymity, say cabinet should view the situation as “gravely serious” because of the aggressiveness of the coronavirus and should not be complacent.
they warn cabinet not to compare the current scenario with the recent measles campaign, in which mhms also requested a temporary ban on incoming travels but was rejected by the attorney general before their submission could even make it to cabinet.
health officials say process to detect the coronavirus is made complicated by the fact that carriers do not often display symptoms for few days, hence would pass detection processes in airports or ports.
island sun understands that cabinet met yesterday to deliberate on the submission by mhms on the china coronavirus; a decision was yet to be made known when this paper went to print last night.
members of public have also taken their concerns to social media, some having turned up at the island sun office to express their fears and concerns that current measures may not be enough to keep out the china coronavirus.
they also share the same idea that a temporary travel ban be imposed on inbound vessels and planes.
however, skeptic health officials tell island sun that regarding their temporary travel ban request for the measles outbreak, the attorney general had turned down the suggestion citing several reasons.
loss of business to aviation, airlines and seaports, and such, were some of the reasons stated and other reasons were financial loss to sig due to travelers claiming compensation for flight and travel disruptions.
“ag also highlighted that our current legislation does not protect or make sig immune to any compensation claimants or such, in such a travel ban scenario,” the health officials say.
island sun understands that the meeting yesterday included government ministries such as the prime minister’s office (pmo), ministry of foreign affairs, communications and aviation, immigrations, the national disaster management office (ndmo), the national security and including unicef and who. the briefing was to ensure all responsible stakeholders are well coordinated and are prepared to respond to the emerging threat of novel coronavirus (2019-ncov) to solomon islands.

“the sars episode in 2003 suggests that the shock could lead to a large impact on economic activity, especially as the fear factor could restrict people’s mobility,” j.p. morgan analysts wrote.

safety sought
elsewhere, investors sought safe-haven assets. gold extended overnight gains to rally 0.2 per cent to usd 1,579.45 per ounce.
wall street turned from positive to close flat.
oil prices, a barometer of the expected impact of the virus on the world’s economy, resumed their slide. us crude and brent crude each shed a percentage point, with brent last trading at usd 59.21 per barrel.
china’s yuan, which had steadied on wednesday, was again falling - dropping 0.2 per cent to 6.9871 per dollar along with other trade-exposed currencies in the region.
the australian dollar, new zealand dollar, korean won all fell, while the safe havens of the japanese yen and swiss franc were firm.
and the mood extended the rally in us government bonds which began after fed chairman powell indicated inflation was too low.
the central bank “is not satisfied with inflation running below 2 per cent and it is not a ceiling,” powell said. with the fed’s targeted core inflation running at 1.6 per cent, the remark was interpreted as scene-setting for a rate cut, with markets now pricing in a 10 per cent chance it could come in march.

""nearly all of resolute’s core businesses have faced very difficult operating conditions over the last year, which, combined with negative news flow, have pushed resolute’s share price near its all-time lows,"" said mr. quinn in a research note released before the bell.
""however, there are some green shoots. we think lumber is well positioned heading into the spring building season. pulp markets have tightened, and we see limited risk of further price reductions. finally, weakness in newsprint and specialty paper markets is likely to prompt a supply-side response (i.e., capacity reduction), in our view. we see the risk-reward as favorable given that the majority of the downside seems currently priced into resolute’s shares.""
moving its stock to “outperform” from “sector perform,” mr. quinn said he expects resolute’s wood products segment to show “significant” improvement in 2020, pointing to an "" attractive near-term outlook for the north american lumber business and new exposure to the u.s. south.""
he also sees pulp markets poised for a turnaround, however he expressed concern about the impact coronavirus fears on demand.

equity analysts at desjardins securities increased their oil price deck for 2020 and 2021 in a research report released thursday afternoon, expressing concern that the market has been slow to factor in “omnipresent geopolitical risk in the middle east.”
“the new decade started with a major geopolitical disturbance following a series of events in iraq which pushed the u.s. and iran to the brink of a direct military conflict. with regard to oil prices, the limp response to the saga represented the third major failed attempt to reintroduce a geopolitical risk premium in response to simmering tensions in the persian gulf,” said justin bouchard, chris macculloch and scott van bolhuis.
“recall that the drums of war initially began beating during last summer’s tanker wars near the strait of hormuz and the downing of a us military drone by iran, the retaliatory air strikes for which president trump called off in the final moments before the mission was executed. this was later followed up by the september attack on the saudi aramco abqaiq and khurais oil fields, which the kingdom asserted was orchestrated by iran, an allegation that found support from the u.s. and other western intelligence agencies. then, on january 3, the u.s. military launched a drone strike in baghdad which killed iranian general qassem soleimani of the islamic revolutionary guard corps, which was followed by an iranian retaliatory attack on two us military bases in iraq. both sides ultimately stepped back from the brink by opting to de-escalate the conflict, which drove a sharp drop in global oil prices. the limp market response to these recent events in the persian gulf suggests that the market will likely need to see the equivalent of ‘boots on the ground’ at this point to spur a meaningful geopolitical risk premium.”
they also noted the headwinds stemming from the coronavirus outbreak, though they think it will likely prove to be a short-term obstacle.
“we continue to see support for oil prices arising from simmering tensions in the persian gulf in tandem with decelerating u.s. production growth and deeper opec+ supply cuts, which we now expect to be rolled over beyond the march deadline,” they said.
growing more constructive on oil market fundamentals, they raised their wti price forecast to us$60 per barrel in 2020 (from us$55l) and us$57.50 in 2021 (from us$55). that increase, coupled with a rise in their natural gas price assumptions, led them to make several target price adjustments to stocks in their coverage universe ahead of fourth-quarter earnings season.
among large-cap stocks, their changes were:
canadian natural resources ltd. ( cnq-t , “buy”) to $47 from $44. the average on the street is $47.08. husky energy inc. ( hse-t , “hold”) to $11 from $12. average: $11.49. ovintiv inc.

rbc dominion securities analyst steve arthur expects to see “solid” growth from cae inc. ( cae-t , cae-n ) when it releases its third-quarter financial results on feb. 7 before the bell.
led by its civil segment, mr. arthur is projecting revenue growth of 13 per cent-year over-year. he's also anticipating segment margin recovery in its defence unit.
“broadly, we expect trends to continue for moderate high single-digit revenue growth, improving margins, contained capex, solid cash generation to reduce leverage, and gradually improving roce [return on capital employed],” he said.
mr. arthur is also anticipating further comment on cae’s role in providing simulators and training to support the return of boeing co. 's ( ba-n ) 737 max.
“cae has (deservedly in our view) received much press in recent weeks following boeing’s comments proposing mandatory simulator training for 737 max pilots as part of that aircraft’s return to flight,"" he said. “as of last quarter, cae had 48 orders for max simulators (we understand roughly half now delivered), along with capacity in its training network for max education. of course cae can’t get ahead of announcements from boeing and the regulators, but we expect further discussion on cae’s order flow, manufacturing and training capacity to address the anticipated max near-term demand surge.”
“we clearly expect incremental demand for cae, but quantifying the sustainable opportunity from max training is a challenge. for some context, we estimate that an incremental 10 simulator units would add 5-10 cents to eps, presumably not a recurring annual event. 5 simulators added to the training network at high utilization might add another 5-10 cents. with the shares up $5.00 since max discussion became mainstream news, a good measure of the incremental earnings potential appears to be reflected.""
calling it an “attractive long-term holding,” mr. arthur maintained an “outperform” rating with a target of $41, rising from $39. the average is $37.44.
following the release of better-than-anticipated first-quarter results on thursday, canaccord genuity analyst robert young raised his financial expectations for real matters inc. ( real-t ), expecting “strength” to continue given “a persisting” low interest rate environment.
“real matters continues to win new business (four top100s in title in the quarter) – despite lenders being preoccupied managing mortgage volumes, suggesting pent-up demand,” the analyst said. “management stated that the pipeline is robust, making us confident in continued share gains, which should mitigate market cycle risk in the long run,” he said.
maintaining a “buy” rating, mr. young hiked his target to $17 from $14. the average on the street is $15.64.
“we have adjusted our estimates post the quarter to reflect improved macro market data and positive results in fq1,” he said. “with mortgage market tailwinds expected to continue in fq2, we have revised our estimates upward and increased adj ebitda margins to reflect the business’ operating leverage. we remain cautious on the forecast accuracy through f2021e and beyond, given the direct relationship with the cyclical mortgage market. we remain confident that real matters’ solution will continue to gain share, which may limit the impact of future interest rate hikes and/or mortgage market pullbacks.”
elsewhere, calling it a “standout” quarter, raymond james analyst steven li increased his target to $16 from $13 with an “outperform” rating (unchanged).
in response to a “solid clean” second-quarter earnings beat, raymond james analyst steven li increased his target price for shares of open text corp. ( otex-q , otex-t ) to us$54 from us$48, keeping an “outperform” rating. the average on the street is us$48.54.
“otex printed a revenue/eps beat for its f2q20 with solid positive organic growth (two quarters in a row),” said mr. li. “the carbonite transaction has closed and is expected to be modestly accretive in its first stub year and then fully on otex operating model exiting f2021. our forecasts and target price are moving up as a result. historically, large transactions have tended to drive share price momentum for otex and carbonite is their second-largest acquisition.”
citi analyst jazon bazinet sees two risks facing twitter inc. ( twtr-n ).
upon assuming coverage of the stock, he said the street's revenue estimates for the social media company are too high beyond 2020, while its cost projections are likely too low.
""a large portion of twitter’s historical revenue growth has stemmed from converting monthly active users to daily active users,"" he said. ""however, the revenue per dau has not increased materially over the last four years. while twitter can continue to migrate maus to daus, there are limits. if twitter matches best-in-class mau to dau conversion (facebook is at 65 per cent), it suggests a revenue ‘ceiling’ of about $5 billion per annum. the street’s forecast eclipses this ceiling in 2023. as such, we expect reductions to the street’s revenue outlook in 2021 and 2022 as the potential revenue ceiling approaches.
“the street expects d&a and sbc costs to represent just 20 per cent of revenues by 2022. however, twitter’s own outlook suggests these two items will likely reflect 23 per cent to 30 per cent of revenues. in addition, academic studies suggest twitter has not made any progress limiting the distribution of misinformation (‘fake news’). facebook, on the other hand, has made material improvements. but, facebook has materially stepped up investments to achieve this. for twitter, the street assumes opex per dau will remain relatively flattish at twitter over the next three years. this may be too bullish.”
given his projections for twitter’s revenue fall short of the consensus estimate and his expense projection exceeds it, mr. bazinet set a “neutral” rating coverage for its stock.
he lowered the firm’s target for twitter shares to us$35 from us$36. the average on the street is us$34.10.
""we will reassess our rating once street estimates more closely reflect the likely trajectory of the financials,"" he said.
at the same time, mr. bazinet assumed coverage of a pair of other companies.
he gave pinterest inc. ( pins-n ) a “buy” rating and us$30 target. the average on the street is us$26.29.
“we like the pinterest for three reasons: first, there is a large opportunity to more effectively monetize non-u.s. users. second, the street’s 2020 estimates look reasonable to us. third, the firm’s valuation looks compelling,” the analyst said.
mr. bazinet set a “neutral” rating and us$20 target for snap inc. ( snap-n ). the average target is us$19.18.
“the company has experienced a robust recovery since 4q18,” he said. “user growth and revenue growth have both reaccelerated. and, this year, the firm may generate positive adjusted ebitda and fcf for the first time.”
“we like the social media sector. and, snap is performing quite well. however, we believe that there is risk to the street’s 2021 and 2022 estimates for both revenues and adj. ebitda. that keeps us on the sidelines.”",[],2020-01-31T08:52:00.000+02:00,2020-01-31T21:14:19.001+02:00,,0.0,116.0,0.0

resources to investigate the expenditure of over $396million on the turnaround maintenance (tam) of the nation’s four refineries between 2013 and 2015. this move followed a motion titled: “the moribund refineries in the country,” sponsored by senator yusuf abubakar yusuf, representing taraba central senatorial district. yusuf, in his lead debate, noted that the country has four petroleum refineries with two located in port harcourt and one each in kaduna and warri, respectively. he noted that the refineries were established to adequately supply and serve needs for liquefied petroleum gas (lpg), premium motor spirit (pms), dual purpose kerosene (dpk), automotive gas oil (ago), low pour fuel oil (lpfo), high pour fuel oil (hpfo) and aviation turbine kerosene (atk) for both local consumption and exports. he lamented that despite the alleged spending of $396million for tam of the refineries between 2013 and 2015 there is no tangible result to show in terms of local production. he insisted that the amounts being expended on tam of the refineries in the last 25 years notwithstanding, nigeria is still solely dependent on importation of petroleum products for domestic use. he said that the country will likely slide into recession once again if the humongous amount for tam is added to the huge ‘under recoveries’ presently being incurred by the nnpc in the importation of petroleum products, put at over n123.25billion. “the country through nnpc has in the past 25 years spent billions of us dollars in turnaround maintenance of the refineries, the latest being over $396million spent between 2013 and 2015 without meaningful result,” yusuf said. he added that “the refineries have remained in moribund state in the last 15-20 years and is almost reaching total collapse due to lack of proposer maintenance of the facilities with a poor average capacity utilization hovering between 15 percent and 25 percent per annum.” senator yusuf said “despite the huge spending on turn-around maintenance of refineries, nnpc recently announced a cumulative loss of n123.25billion in 10 months (january to october, 2019), putting the total revenue of facilities at n68.82billion, while total expenses incurred was n192.1billion within the same period.” he warned that “such huge wastage and slippages amidst the nation’s tight economy, if not addressed, may lead the country back to recession.” “such losses, when averted and combined with the huge expenditures in ‘under recovery’ on fuel pump price and properly channelled into full rehabilitation and construction of modern refineries, would positively impact on the economy and save the country from the embarrassment of importation of petroleum products and its ripple effect,” he said. in his contribution, senator ibikunle amosun (ogun central) said one of the challenges confronting the country is lack of maintenance culture. he said it was not the first time attention was being drawn to the near collapse of the refineries in the country. he urged his colleagues to do a thorough job during the investigation process. “oil should be a blessing to us but in nigeria, it makes a lot of establishments lazy. we should be concern about it. “the refineries are bad and people are now taking the crude outside the country and bringing back refined products to the country on exorbitant prices,” amosun said. in its resolutions mandated the committee on petroleum downstream, upstream and gas to carry out a holistic investigation on the turnaround maintenance expenditures and the current state of the refineries as well as convoke stakeholders’ conference with the aim of finding ways to revamp them. meanwhile, worried by the recent outbreak of the deadly disease – coronavirus in china, which has spread quickly to some other countries, the senate, yesterday, advised the federal ministry of aviation to immediately take steps to ensure that all persons arriving from china, especially chinese citizens, be self-isolated for, at least, two weeks to ascertain their health status before mixing up with the public. the senate also extended the call for self-isolation to travellers from other countries that had recorded incidents of the infection. the upper chamber also advised the nigerians who intend to travel to asian countries to put all arrangements on hold until the coronavirus outbreak is eliminated. the lawmakers further called on the federal government to allocate more funds to the nigeria centre for disease control (ncdc) to enable it be at its best to ensure the safety of the people. these resolutions, among others, came sequel to the consideration of a motion titled: “coronavirus outbreak and preventive response towards stemming it’s spread in nigeria”, sponsored by senator chukwuka utazi (enugu north). utazi, in his presentation, explained that the virus was spread through the air by coughing or sneezing, close personal contact, touching a contaminated object or surface, and rarely by facial contamination. he added that the human coronavirus was previously reported to cause severe symptoms such as acute respiratory syndrome, following the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-ncov) outbreak that began in wuhan, china. utazi recalled that in response to the outbreak of the killer virus, “china put millions of people in three of its cities on lockdown in an effort to contain a coronavirus outbreak that has killed 170 and infected more than 7,000 persons.” according to him, “health officials fear the number of infected people will rise rapidly as hundreds of millions of chinese people travel within china and abroad during the weeklong lunar new year which begin on saturday.” the lawmaker commended the efforts already being made by the federal ministry of health through the nigeria centre for disease control (ncdc) in monitoring the outbreak of the respiratory tract infection caused by the coronavirus. according to him, the aviation regulatory agencies recently stepped up surveillance across operating airlines and international airports nationwide, as well as issued a travel advisory in a bid to contain any case of the coronavirus pandemic. in his contribution to the motion, senator james manager (delta south), raised alarm that nigeria and other countries are at risk of experiencing an outbreak given what he described as the uncontrolled influx of chinese nationals from one country to another. manager, who likened the coronavirus to the deadly ebola virus, urged nigerian authorities to rise to the occasion, warning that “almost all powerful countries in the world are already affected.” in his remarks, senator jibrin barau (kano north), described the motion as a wake-up call for health officials across the country to deploy early preventive measures. his words, “i was thinking whether our health officials are doing everything possible to prevent the coming of this disease into the country. “this motion is a wake-up call to our health officials to deploy preventive measures. “we should find a way to send a message through this motion to make sure the proper thing is done to a safeguard the health of citizens and the nation,” the lawmaker advised. while the lawmakers advised nigerians to maintain good personal hygiene by constantly washing their hands with water and soap or through the use of liquid sanitizers, they also urged nigerians with any reported cases of likely infection or with symptoms similar to those associated with coronavirus to visit hospitals for urgent health

the issue began earlier this week, said the woman, who asked to remain anonymous.
she told the langley advance times by email that although her husband had no symptoms of illness, some parents contacted her on wechat, a chinese-language social media app, and asked that she quarantine herself at home and keep her child away from school.
she says she refused, and some other parents told their children not to play with hers. some students were kept at home, she believes to avoid her child. she is worried there are other children who may be being kept at home because of similar pressure to self-quarantine.
“i believe there more families are suffering from the same discrimination and bullying in langley,” the woman said.
the mother hasn’t talked to her child’s teacher, saying she’s worried she’ll be identified as speaking out.
she did send a letter to the school district, and was hoping a public notice could help the situation.
a request for comment to the langley school district was forwarded to b.c.’s ministry of education, which issued this statement:
• the provincial health officer is advising that the risk of spread of this virus within british columbia remains low at this time and that all necessary precautions are being taken to prevent the spread of infection.
• we ask that people do not make assumptions about a person’s potential risk based on their ethnicity or travel history.
• the ministry of health has confirmed that individuals returning from affected regions do not need to be isolated at home or kept home from school.
the coronavirus has infected almost 10,000 people, most of them in china, and only three confirmed cases have been announced as of friday in canada, all among people who recently traveled to china.
more than 200 people have died in total, all in china, with the disease having a fatality rate of around two per cent, with older people and those with previous health issues making up most of the deceased.

the researchers from cybersecurity firm kaspersky have detected such malicious files which were masked under the guise of pdf, mp4 and docx files about the coronavirus.
the names of files imply that they contain video instructions on how to stay protected from the virus, updates on the threat and even virus detection procedures.
in fact, these files contained a range of threats from trojans to worms which are capable of destroying, blocking, modifying or copying data, as well as interfering with the operation of computers or computer networks.
“the coronavirus, which is being widely discussed as a major news story, has already been used as bait by cybercriminals. so far we have seen only 10 unique files, but as this sort of activity often happens with popular media topics then we expect that this tendency may grow,” kaspersky malware analyst anton ivanov said in a statement.
“as people continue to be worried for their health, we may see more and more malware hidden inside fake documents about the coronavirus being spread,” ivanov said.
the world health organization (who) has declared the novel coronavirus outbreaka global health emergency after the death toll in china increased to 213 on friday, with 9,692 confirmed in the country’s 31 provincial-level regions.
nearly 100 confirmed cases have been reported from 18 countries, outside china.
to avoid falling victim to malicious programmes pretending to be exclusive content, people should try to avoid suspicious links, promising exclusive content and refer to official sources for trustworthy and legitimate information, kaspersky recommended.

the big stock charts featured this week have mostly been cautious at best. owing to skittish broad market trading amid coronavirus fears, the focus mostly has been on stocks with potential downside, particularly if u.s. stocks began a long-awaited correction. source: shutterstock
but it’s worth remembering that the financial news of the past few sessions hasn’t been that bad. equities showed strength on thursday, with all three major indices rallying into the close to post solid gains for the day. those indices still are not far from all-time highs.
underlying performance continues to be reasonably strong. indeed, the three most valuable u.s. companies have posted impressive results this week, assuming amazon (nasdaq: amzn ) passes alphabet (nasdaq: goog ,nasdaq: googl ) for third place. and amazon likely will move in behind apple (nasdaq: aapl ) and microsoft (nasdaq: msft ) after a blowout fourth quarter report on thursday afternoon.
in that vein, friday’s big stock charts take a more optimistic perspective, focusing on names with potential upside ahead. two of these stocks have attractive technical setups. another has room for a bounce after support held. as always, broad market sentiment has to cooperate. but investors looking for trades with upside should take a long look at these three charts. lyft (lyft) source: provided by finviz
lyft (nasdaq: lyft ) stock has struggled since its initial public offering ten months ago. and no doubt many investors remain deeply skeptical of the ride-sharing model.
but the first of friday’s big stock charts shows an attractive technical setup and a potential catalyst looming just a week and a half out: resistance has held for lyft stock around current levels going back to september, but the lows since then have moved higher. that creates a classic ascending triangle and suggests momentum is building as the stock tries to clear resistance. shares clearly have exited a downtrend, even posting a bit of a reversal from a modestly narrowing descending wedge. simply put, this is an attractive chart right now. the fundamental case for lyft might seem less bullish. after all, the company remains unprofitable even on an adjusted ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) basis. true net profitability might not arrive until 2023. but as i detailed just this week, lyft has a more intriguing case than one might think. performance over the past few quarters has been hugely impressive relative to expectations. and yet lyft shares have lagged those of rival uber (nyse: uber ), whose 2019 performance has been uneven and whose stock is more expensive. combine another earnings beat with the chart and the fundamentals and lyft has a real chance to break out. if lyft can post another beat when it reports fourth quarter earnings on feb. 11, the chart is set up for a nice post-earnings rally. of course, that’s a big ‘if,’ and lyft has struggled despite topping analyst expectations in each of its first three quarters. with a cheaper price and a better chart, however, this time might be different. hd supply (hds) source: provided by finviz
hd supply (nasdaq: hds ) has a similar chart, but with one key difference: it looks like the breakout has begun. the second of our big stock charts looks bullish, and the industrial distributor has a solid fundamental case as well: hds stock has formed an ascending triangle and on thursday managed to break through resistance to a six-month high. it’s possible that the stock will dip back below the key level of $41. but hds has seen solid volume in three straight green sessions, with particularly heavy buying yesterday. moving averages have converged, setting up a “golden cross” as well. this simply looks like a stock ready to take off. from a valuation perspective, there’s plenty of reason for optimism as well. hds stock trades at a little over 13x fiscal 2021 (ending january) earnings per share estimates. other industrial distributors like w.w. grainger (nyse: gww ) and fastenal (nasdaq: fast ) have far higher multiples. hd supply is separating into two public companies in a bid to close that valuation gap which could create a near- to mid-term opportunity. there are risks. most notably, both technically and fundamentally hds needs external conditions to stay positive. but hd supply stock looks like an intriguing trade for market bulls who are wary of owning an unprofitable name like lyft. melco resorts & entertainment (mlco) source: provided by finviz
melco resorts & entertainment (nasdaq: mlco ) unsurprisingly has had a rough couple of sessions. the company’s casino operations in macau are under significant threat from the spread of coronavirus in china and asia more broadly.
but as the third of friday’s big stock charts shows, there is hope for a reversal: simply put, buyers stepped in. support at this point has been confirmed repeatedly at $19. that level doesn’t suggest zero downside from thursday’s close, but traders looking to play the range might well see mlco as having a favorable risk/reward setup at this point. click to enlarge source: provided by finviz taking the longer view, the case does seem a bit weaker. like larger rivals las vegas sands (nyse: lvs ) and wynn resorts (nasdaq: wynn ), mlco has traded sideways going back to 2013, albeit with a lot of volatility. investors who believe the recent sell-off is overdone might well look to those larger names instead. but mlco is a purer play on macau than either sands or wynn, who have significant operations elsewhere. it’s too early to argue that mlco, this time, is set for a consistent and sustainable rally. but it seems pretty clear that, at least for now, investors are willing to step into any declines under $20. that makes mlco one of the more interesting buys for investors who believe coronavirus fears are overdone — and for traders who see a reversal on the way.
as of this writing, vince martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

the advice comes as hundreds of properties remain available via the room-booking platform in wuhan, part of china’s central hubei province, where the deadly virus is believed to have originated.
in one message, airbnb advised hosts in the region to pay close attention to the development of the epidemic, and be supportive if a guest’s itinerary plans changed suddenly.
“airbnb has launched a special cancellation policy for housing bookings in wuhan,” said the chinese-language message, adding that hosts keep in touch with tenants. ultimately, airbnb has left it up to each host whether or not to accept bookings.
“we have activated our extenuating circumstances policy to offer impacted hosts and guests the option of a cancellation of their reservations without charges,” said an airbnb spokesman in a statement. “we will be continuously evaluating and updating this policy.”
the world health organization’s emergency committee is meeting on thursday to consider whether to declare the coronavirus that has killed 170 people worldwide so far a “public health emergency of international concern.” airlines are curtailing flights to the nation, and several countries have begun evacuating citizens from the most stricken zone around the city of wuhan, which remains quarantined.
hundreds of properties in wuhan were shown as available on airbnb for as soon as the night of jan. 30, with discounts of as much as 15% offered as a new year promotion.
a bloomberg news reporter was able to successfully complete a booking, with payment taken from a u.k. credit card, without being advised on airbnb’s app or in confirmation emails of current health and travel guidance.
in a follow-up message, the host said they had kept reservations open to help people unable to return to their hometown find a place to stay. the process is similar for hotels and their relationships with sites like booking.com. a search for a place to stay in wuhan on booking.com using a u.k.-based computer website produces a wide range of hotel options. however, there was confusion over whether hotels were open for business.
sold out
booking.com shows the hilton wuhan riverside as sold out for the night of jan. 31. on the hotel’s own website, more detail is provided: “as a precautionary measure in line with prevention efforts across china and local government requirements, hilton wuhan riverside will temporarily stop taking bookings from now until 15 february 2020.”
an identical message is given to shoppers attempting to book at another of hilton’s wuhan hotels, the hilton wuhan optics valley.
however, on thursday afternoon in london, booking.com’s website said the hilton wuhan riverside had been booked twice in the previous six hours. there was no health warning visible to potential visitors.
a spokeswoman for hilton worldwide holdings inc. said “we do not control third party sites or how they display their listings,” but added that warnings and health advice is displayed on hilton’s own websites.
booking.com did not respond to a request for comment.
airbnb is one of many technology companies having to tackle the economic impact of the deadly virus. on tuesday, apple inc. issued a wider-than-usual sales forecast to reflect what chief executive officer tim cook called “uncertainty” caused by the outbreak. nvidia corp., the biggest maker of computer graphics chips, told its workers in china to stay home and any others returning from the country to work from home for two weeks, people with knowledge of the matter said. travel to china should be postponed, nvidia told employees. facebook inc. has also implemented similar policies.

beijing — president xi jinping has ordered chinese military to keep its mission firmly in mind and shoulder responsibility to make contributions to winning the battle against the novel coronavirus epidemic.
xi, also general secretary of the communist party of china (cpc) central committee and chairman of the central military commission, made the remarks in a recent instruction to the military on the prevention and control of the outbreak of pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus.
the military resolutely implemented the decisions and arrangements of the cpc central committee after the novel coronavirus outbreak in wuhan of hubei province, xi said, adding that the armed forces rapidly initiated the joint prevention and control mechanism and sent elite medical teams to combat the epidemic at the frontline.
xi said the epidemic prevention and control remained grim and complex and demanded the armed forces shoulder their responsibility, fight the hard battle and actively assist local authorities in fighting the epidemic.
the armed forces are tasked with treating patients in huoshenshan hospital in wuhan, which reflects the high level of trust that the party and the people place in them, xi said.
to meet the expectations and fulfill the task, the military must strengthen leadership, enhance coordination with local authorities, adhere to scientific treatment, and pay attention to their own protection, xi added.
huoshenshan hospital, which is under construction, is a makeshift hospital dedicated to treating patients infected with the novel coronavirus.
xi ordered military hospitals engaged in the epidemic control to treat patients with all-out efforts and military research institutions to step up scientific research to contribute to winning the battle against the epidemic.
supply of daily necessities stable
supply of daily necessities remains steady in major chinese cities while authorities are stepping up efforts to ensure continuous supply and stable prices amid the novel coronavirus outbreak.
inventory of daily necessities including meat, rice and cooking oil is generally sufficient in major cities across the country, according to the ministry of commerce (moc).
moc data showed that current reserves in wuhan, the central chinese city at the epicenter of the outbreak, can secure supply of rice and cooking oil for over 15 days, pork and eggs for over 10 days, and vegetables for about five days.
supply of vegetables in 46 wholesale markets and supermarket franchises in beijing ticked up about 10 percent during the spring festival holiday, while the eastern city of nanjing kept a local government reserve of staple vegetables that can last seven to 10 days.
on the production front, output of winter and spring vegetables grew 2.7 percent year on year to 770,000 tons, according to data from 1,000 vegetable information sites monitored by the ministry of agriculture and rural affairs (mara).
in response to the groceries shopping spree in some cities, moc official wang bin said the government and the private sector are making all-out efforts to expand market supply of daily necessities and advised against panic shopping.
wang said the government is taking measures to tackle logistic barriers and labor crunch caused by the outbreak. mara analyst zhang jing stressed smoothing transportation as the next priority.
the government has pledged efforts to sustain continuous supply of necessities to coronavirus-stricken areas, with the national development and reform commission arranging daily transport of vegetables, cooking oil, rice, and flour to wuhan.
other measures include expanding production of winter and spring vegetables, as well as coordinating wholesale markets across the country to replenish supply of vegetables, meat and eggs in infection affected areas.
supermarkets and online retailers including walmart, yonghui superstores and freshhema have vowed to ensure supply without raising prices during the holidays and despite the virus outbreak, said wang.

pilots and flight attendants are demanding airlines stop flights to china as health officials declare a global emergency over the rapidly spreading coronavirus, with american airlines’ pilots filing a lawsuit seeking an immediate halt.
china has reported nearly 10,000 cases and 213 deaths, but the virus has spread to 18 countries, mostly, presumably, by airline passengers.
the united states has advised its citizens not to travel to china, raising its warning to the same level as those for iraq and afghanistan.
us airlines, which have been reducing flights to china this week, were reassessing flying plans as a result, according to people familiar with the matter.
it is possible the white house could opt to take further action to bar flights to china in coming days, but officials stressed that no decision has been made.
the allied pilots association (apa), which represents american airlines pilots, cited “serious, and in many ways still unknown, health threats posed by the coronavirus” in a lawsuit filed in texas, where the airline is based.
american said it was taking precautions against the virus but had no immediate comment on the lawsuit. on wednesday, it announced flight cancellations from los angeles to beijing and shanghai, but is continuing flights from dallas.
apa president eric ferguson urged pilots assigned to us-china flights to decline the assignment. in a statement, the american airlines’ flight attendants union said they supported the pilots’ lawsuit and called on the company and the u.s. government to “err on the side of caution and halt all flights to and from china.”
pilots at united airlines, the largest us airline to china, concerned for their safety will be allowed to drop their trip without pay, according to a wednesday memo from their union to members.
united announced on thursday another 332 us-china flight cancellations between february and march 28, though it will continue operating round trip flights from san francisco to beijing, shanghai and hong kong.
the american airlines pilot lawsuit came as an increasing number of airlines stopped their flights to mainland china, including air france klm sa, british airways, germany’s lufthansa and virgin atlantic.
other major carriers have kept flying to china, but protective masks and shorter layovers designed to reduce exposure have done little to reassure crews.
‘countdown’ a us flight attendant who recently landed from one major chinese city said a big concern is catching the virus and spreading it to families, or getting quarantined while on a layover. “i didn’t understand the gravity of the situation until i went there,” she said on condition of anonymity, describing general paranoia on the return flight, with every passenger wearing a mask.
“now i feel like i’m on a 14-day countdown.”
thai airways is hosing its cabins with disinfectant spray between china flights and allowing crew to wear masks and gloves.
delta air lines is operating fewer flights and offering food deliveries so crew can stay in their hotels. the carrier is also allowing pilots to drop china trips without pay, a memo from its union to members said.
korean air lines co ltd and singapore airlines are sending additional crew to fly each plane straight back, avoiding overnight stays.
the south korean carrier also said it was loading protective suits for flight attendants who might need to take care of suspected coronavirus cases in the air.
airlines in asia are seeing a big drop in bookings along with forced cancellations because of the coronavirus outbreak, the head of aircraft lessor avolon holdings ltd said, adding the impact could last for some months.
the outbreak poses the biggest epidemic threat to the airline industry since the 2003 sars crisis, which led to a 45% plunge in passenger demand in asia at its peak in april of that year, analysts said.
fitch ratings said airlines with more moderate exposure to china and the asia-pacific region were likely to be able to re-deploy capacity to alternative routes to mitigate the effect on traffic, but that could increase competition on those routes and reduce airfares.
air france, which maintained china flights throughout the sars epidemic, suspended its beijing and shanghai flights on thursday after cabin crews demanded an immediate halt.
“when the staff see that other airlines have stopped flying there, their reaction is ‘why are we still going?’,” said flore arrighi, president of unac, one of the airline’s four main flight attendants’ unions. --reuters-- ",[],2020-01-31T02:00:00.000+02:00,2020-01-31T13:07:57.001+02:00,,0.0,26.0,0.0

a taxi driver wears a mask as he drives on a street in shanghai, china january 30, 2020. reuters/aly song showroom traffic is expected to be sparse when extended lunar new year holidays end as much of the population is steering clear of public spaces, while output is set to plunge in the short-term.
that is particularly true of hubei province, the center of the outbreak, a major automotive industrial hub that accounts for nearly 9% of china’s vehicle production and home to factories for many car makers including dongfeng motor group ( 0489.hk ) and its partners honda motor ( 7267.t ), renault sa ( rena.pa ) and psa ( peup.pa ).
“we expect (china) vehicle production to decline 3% for the full year, with production down 15% in the first quarter, including the extended new year shutdown,” joseph massaro, cfo for auto technology supplier aptiv ( aptv.n ), told an earnings conference call.
but he said delayed production could be made up in the second quarter. “we don’t view this as a full year issue at the moment.”
seeking to rein in the epidemic, which has killed more than 200 people with nearly 9,700 confirmed cases of infection in china, authorities have extended lunar new year holidays by three days to feb. 2 although many areas and companies are telling workers not to come back before feb. 10.
prior to the outbreak, forecasts for the world’s largest auto market this year had ranged from mild sales growth to small declines after two painful years of contraction due to a slowing economy, the u.s.-china trade war and the chaotic introduction of new emission rules.
cui dongshu, secretary general at the china passenger car association, said his prediction for industry-wide sales growth of 1% this year now “under some pressure”.
the holiday extension has discouraged dealers from ordering new cars from manufacturers at the end of the month as is their usual practice, virtually guaranteeing a decline in wholesale auto sales figures for january.
“although sales volumes in the first three weeks of january were okay, there was no ‘sales sprint’ at the end of the month. so it is inevitable that we will see a significant sales drop,” cui said in a blog post.
the big unknown is, however, just how far the outbreak, which authorities have said they expect to peak in february, will ravage chinese consumer spending.
industry officials and analysts agree car sales will be hit in the short-term but also say the impact might not be too bad over the whole year.
the outbreak could even change the mindset of the chinese consumer towards car ownership, given that many are suffering in areas where public transport has been suspended, said yale zhang, head of shanghai-based consultancy autoforesight.
“it is hard to predict its impact in the longer term. customers who do not have their own car might realize they need one which might help sales this year,” he said.
automakers with plants in hubei, particularly in its capital wuhan, which has seen its transport links cut off as part of a lock down to curb the virus, will have the most work to do in rejigging production plans. production delays can often be made up later with extra shifts on weekends and at night.
main roads are seen in shanghai, china january 30, 2020. reuters/aly song honda, which has three assembly plants in wuhan with dongfeng, said it was assessing how transport disruptions were affecting the supply of parts and that no decision had been made on when its factories will restart.
psa’s venture with dongfeng said in a statement it will extend the lunar new year holidays for its workers but has not decided on a precise date.
renault plans to adjust its wuhan production plans in line with guidance from local authorities, a company representative said. a dongfeng representative said the company’s decision on when to resume work will depend on the situation of the virus outbreak.

geneva — the world health organization declared the outbreak sparked by a new virus in china that has been exported to more than a dozen countries as a global emergency thursday after the number of cases spiked more than tenfold in a week.
the u.n. health agency defines an international emergency as an ""extraordinary event"" that constitutes a risk to other countries and requires a coordinated international response.
china first informed who about cases of the new virus in late december. to date, china has reported more than 7,800 cases including 170 deaths. eighteen other countries have since reported cases, as scientists race to understand how exactly the virus is spreading and how severe it is.
experts say there is significant evidence the virus is spreading among people in china and have noted with concern instances in other countries — including the united states, france, japan, germany, canada and vietnam — where there have also been isolated cases of human-to-human transmission.
speaking to reporters in geneva, who director-general tedros adhanom ghebreyesus noted the worrisome spread of the virus between people outside china.
the main reason for this declaration is not because of what is happening in china but because of what is happening in other countries, he said. """"our greatest concern is the potential for this virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems which are ill-prepared to deal with it.""
""this declaration is not a vote of non-confidence in china...on the contrary, who continues to have the confidence in china’s capacity to control the outbreak,"" he said.
on thursday, france confirmed that a doctor who was in contact with a patient with the new virus later became infected himself. the doctor is now being treated in an isolated room at a paris hospital. outbreak specialists worry that the spread of new viruses from patients to health workers can signal the virus is becoming adapted to human transmission.
a declaration of a global emergency typically brings greater money and resources, but may also prompt nervous governments to restrict travel and trade to affected countries. the announcement also imposes more disease reporting requirements on countries.
china raised the death toll to 170 on thursday and more countries reported infections, including some spread locally, as foreign evacuees from china's worst-hit region returned home to medical tests and even isolation.
russia announced it was closing its 2,600-mile border with china, joining mongolia and north korea in barring crossings to guard against a new viral outbreak. it had been de facto closed because of the lunar new year holiday, but russian authorities said the closure would be extended until march 1.
train traffic between the countries was halted except for one train connecting moscow and beijing, but air traffic between the two countries continued, at least for now. russia has not confirmed any cases of the virus.
meanwhile, the united states and south korea confirmed their first cases virus. the man in the u.s. is married to a 60-year-old chicago a trip to wuhan, the chinese city that is the epicenter of the outbreak.
there have been cases reported of the infectious virus spreading to others in a household or workplace in china and elsewhere. the case in south korea was a 56-year-old man who had contact with a patient who was diagnosed with the new virus earlier.
the new virus has now infected more people in china than were sickened there during the 2002-2003 outbreak of sars, a cousin of the new virus.
the latest figures for mainland china show an increase of 38 deaths and 1,737 cases for a total of 7,736 confirmed cases. of the new deaths, 37 were in hubei province, of which wuhan is the capital, and one was in the southwestern province of sichuan. outside china, there are 82 infections in 18 countries, according to who.
china extended its lunar new year holiday to sunday to try to keep people home, but the wave of returning travelers could potentially cause the virus to spread further.
transport ministry spokesman wu chungeng outlined a series of rigorous temperature checks and other ""severe measures"" to detect possibly infectious passengers. transport restrictions such as those isolating wuhan and suspending inter-provincial bus services would remain in place, wu said.
""it's definitely very challenging, but we're confident we can exert effective control,"" wu told reporters at the briefing.
to date, about 99% of the cases are in china. ryan estimated the death rate of the new virus at 2%, but said the figure was very preliminary. with fluctuating numbers of cases and deaths, scientists are only able to produce a rough estimate of the fatality rate and it’s likely many milder cases of the virus are being missed.
in comparison, the sars virus killed about 10% of people who caught it. the new virus is from the coronavirus family, which includes those that can cause the common cold as well as more serious illnesses such as sars and mers.
chinese authorities have demanded anyone who traveled from or through wuhan report to health authorities and self-quarantine themselves for 14 days, the maximum incubation period during which patients can be infectious even if they don't show symptoms.
china has been largely praised for a swift and effective response to the outbreak, although questions have been raised about the police suppression of what were early on considered mere rumors — a reflection of the one-party communist state's determination to maintain a monopoly on information in spite of smart phones and social media.
that stands in stark contrast to the initial response to sars, when medical reports were hidden as state secrets. the delayed response was blamed for allowing the disease to spread worldwide, killing around 800 people.

""every time you look at a new set of amazon numbers there seems to be something new to get excited about,"" he said, pointing to growth in amazon's fledging efforts to sell directly to businesses. but the stock gain could trigger further conversations about consolidation in the stock market, considering a handful of tech companies now account for roughly a fifth of the s&p 500. see here: if amazon shares open up as much as expected, the company could soon approach the same value as germany's entire benchmark stock index ($1.15 trillion). hyett points out that these companies aren't as monolithic as they may seem at first blush. amazon has the characteristics of a retailer, google dominates in marketing and microsoft makes software — all distinct parts of the tech universe, he notes. still, it means the us stock market is heavily exposed to a specific type of company: one with a marquee credit rating that is focused on high growth.

(bloomberg) -- sales of latin american oil cargoes to china have ground to a halt this week as the deepening crisis around the coronavirus further stifles an already quiet holiday period.
zero sales have been reported since last week for march-loading cargoes from brazil and colombia and unsold cargoes are piling up, according to people familiar with the matter. interest from buyers has been sluggish. china hasn’t so far canceled or postponed any cargoes set to load in february, the people said.
it’s the latest ripple effect from the coronavirus, which has so far left 170 dead and infected at least 8,000 people in china, threatening to hit economic growth in the world’s biggest oil importer. crude futures are heading for their worst month since may, prompting opec and its allies to consider holding an emergency meeting in february.
refineries in china -- which take 30% of shipments from brazil, colombia and other major latin exporters -- are expected to cut production amid speculation that travel restrictions put in place to halt the spread of the coronavirus will dampen demand for gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. china’s importance to the oil market has grown sharply in recent years, with its share of global oil consumption doubling since 2003.
brazil has become the main latin american oil supplier to china, surpassing venezuela, which is plagued by sanctions and an economic and humanitarian crisis. brazilian oil lula is, after russian espo, the most sought-after grade by china’s independent refineries, known as teapots. the teapots are the most exposed to a drop in domestic consumption and are likely to be hit the hardest by the impact of the coronavirus, according to oil traders in asia.
the blocking of the chinese city of wuhan, capital of the hubei province, epicenter of the virus outbreak, is making it more difficult to move oil products causing a chain effect that’s translating into more pressure on refining margins for the teapots, according to a chinese trader. the volume of unsold brazilian crude for arrival in april -- loading in february and march -- is significant, he said, with many barrels still looking for a home.
china has long feasted on heavy, high-sulfur latin american oil as a cheap feedstock for its expanding refinery capacity. the top 3 most imported grades from latin america are lula, venezuelan merey and colombian castilla, data compiled by bloomberg shows.

the coronavirus outbreak has dominated headlines for the past few weeks as officials rush to keep the spread of the new viral infection contained.
in the last couple of days, the british government has taken the decision to evacuate british nationals from wuhan, the chinese city at the epicentre of the virus.
around 200 british nationals were originally scheduled to fly out of wuhan on thursday 30 january 2020. due to delays in getting permissions, they are now expected to fly home a day later, on friday 31 january.
officials have assured the public that the government is pushing to organise a flight as soon as possible.

as a precaution, returning brits will be quarantined at a secure nhs facility for 14 days upon their return.
this quarantine period was confirmed by uk health secretary matt hancock, who tweeted on 29 jan, “we are working hard to get british nationals back from wuhan.”
he added that “public safety is the top priority.” are returning brits likely to have contracted coronavirus?
though the government hasn’t made any comment on testing or treatment of returning british nationals, it is thought that they will be tested with a throat swab when they land, determining whether any have contracted the virus.
those who test positive could be put in quarantine, whilst those already showing symptoms will likely be taken to hospital.
coronavirus can take time to incubate before symptoms appear. the purpose of the 14 day quarantine is a precaution in case any returning british nationals begin to show symptoms that they hadn’t upon arrival.

almost 100 people across the uk have been tested for coronavirus, and all results so far have come back negative.
although nobody has yet contracted coronavirus in the uk, the nhs is preparing to deal with cases as several experts warn that the virus will eventually reach the uk.

seated in a walled park in hong kong, (from left) amy taylor, qu xuejing (or “zoe”), alan taylor and zoe’s husband, wang wei, pose for a photo during a visit by the taylors that was abruptly cut short because of the chinese government’s shutting down of tourist destinations in hopes of curbing the transmission of a deadly new form of coronavirus that has spread from central china to a growing swath of the world. (photo: furnished) the deadly coronavirus that has spread from china to a dozen or more countries, including the united states, hasn’t sickened anyone in kentucky yet, so far as is known. but it effectively chased a henderson couple halfway across the world. alan and amy taylor departed for hong kong on jan. 21 to visit a young chinese woman they hosted in their home and befriended when she was a graduate student, and to meet her new husband. they also scheduled a guided tour of mainland china that would take them to beijing and a variety of popular tourist destinations. but just a day and a half after arriving, the taylors got a call from their travel agency to advise them that the great wall and other tourist spots they hoped to visit had been closed to limit the spread of the mysterious new virus, which causes a respiratory illness that can be fatal. they could get a refund on their tour, but they had to decide right then. with their touring plans scuttled, they quickly decided to request the refund and scramble to secure two tickets on airplanes that were rapidly filling up as foreigners fled china. what’s remarkable is, this wasn’t the worst part of what alan taylor would call “the trip from hell.” let’s start at the beginning. in 2017, the taylors agreed to host for three weeks a 24-year-old chinese woman, qu xuejing, who was studying to become a schoolteacher and was traveling to henderson to shadow a local teacher at work. she had selected the english name zoe. “we fell in love with her,” amy said. “she called us grandmama and grandpapa … she’s got a magnetic personality.” the affection was mutual; with financial help from the taylors and friends, zoe returned that summer for a fun visit. a third visit would follow. amy taylor cherishes letters and inscriptions in greeting cards in which zoe — who is fluent in speaking and writing in english — expresses her affection and love for the taylors and experiences and food they shared with her, from driving a tractor and letting her climb into a deer stand to trying barbecue (which she loved) and sweet corn (which she found far too sweet to her taste). fast forward to 2020. zoe was newly married and the taylors were preparing to celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary. a big trip to visit zoe and her husband, wang wei, for a few days and then to tour mainland china seemed ideal to the taylors, who have traveled multiple times to europe and elsewhere. on the afternoon of jan. 21, the taylors and 187 other passengers and crew members were flying in an airbus a350-900 jetliner high above the arctic ocean en route to seoul, south korea. it was to be one of many stops on their two-week journey. then something happened.
alan and amy taylor’s shortened excursion to china ended with a cramped 15-hour flight back to the u.s. wearing masks as a precaution against being infected by a new coronavirus that had swept across china and conceivably could have been borne by someone on the plane. (photo: photo furnished) “i know when we were cruising at 40,000 feet and he (the pilot) made a sharp turn, you don’t do that,” alan taylor said. “it kind of made the hair stand up on the back of my neck,” amy said. over the intercom, the pilot informed the passengers of “a little mechanical problem with one of the engines,” alan said. at 2:15 p.m. local time, the pilots advised the tower at fairbanks (alaska) international airport that they were diverting their flight and would be landing there, according to a subsequent account in the fairbanks daily news-miner newspaper. it gave the taylors an opportunity to see the remoteness of the country they were flying over, deep in the interior of alaska. “there were hundreds of miles of nothing — just snow and mountains and trees,” alan said. fairbanks itself has a population not much bigger than henderson. delta flight 159 made its unscheduled landing at 3:46 p.m. when the plane stopped, its passengers found themselves surrounded by fire trucks and other safety and emergency apparatus. clearly, their situation had been potentially perilous. subsequently, passengers were informed that one of the airplane’s two engines had failed in-flight “and the pilot had never flown with one engine before,” according to alan. “he did a good job for a guy who had never done it before,” he said. but the taylors and the rest now found themselves in fairbanks in the dead of winter. the temperature when they arrived was 19 degrees below zero. “it was the off-season there,” amy said. what few daily flights depart fairbanks in january were mostly regional jaunts to destinations such as anaktuvuk, manley hot springs and prudhoe bay/deadhorse.
amy and alan taylor pose for a photo while on a scenic cruiise on hong kong’s harbor. when not posing for pictures, the taylors and their chinese friends routinely wore masks to reduce the risk of exposure to coronavirus.

on friday, new zealand’s top health official, director-general ashley bloomfield announced a patient had been placed in isolation in auckland hospital.
but unlike five previous suspected cases which turned out to be false positives this patient bore the hallmarks of a real infection, the director general told the media.
""this is the first person who has been investigated who meets the definition of the suspected case criteria,"" he said.
dr. michael baker a public health expert from the university of otago said that samoan and new zealand authorities should be cooperating to stop the spread of the disease.
“everywhere in the world is only one or two plane trips away [from a case of infection],” he said in an interview with the samoa observer on friday.
the virus has now spread to a total of 23 countries and more than 9000 cases of infection have been registered.
dr. baker said that its symptoms could range in severity from something resembling the common cold to pneumonia.
advertisement “while in new zealand that might be manageable, those tertiary [healthcare] services are not available in samoa,” he said.
“when you look at the [virus’] threat level you must think about the host environment [and the quality of healthcare] to understand the differences”.
professor baker pointed to the examples of recent difference in the impact of measles epidemics in new zealand, which recorded no deaths, and in samoa, where the official death toll stands at 83.
“we’re only a step away [in new zealand],” he said.
“it’s very important that we not export the virus to the pacific.
“if samoa hasn’t started a conversation with new zealand health authorities they need to do so now.”
professor baker said it had yet to be established whether sustained transmission of the virus would take place in new zealand, which would be the main determinant of the level of threat posed to samoa.
but he said the new zealand government should be prepared to consider a range of options to contain the virus’ potential spread to samoa from ceasing flights to the country altogether to mandatory exit screening for passengers.
under recently passed border controls visitors to samoa from coronavirus affected countries must spend at least 14 days in a country free of the virus and undergo medical clearance before arrival.

""human trading tends to be emotional but machine trading is very dispassionate,"" said scott wacker, global head of fixed income, currency and commodity e-sales at jpmorgan, one bank at the forefront of the algo revolution. ""as a result, the reaction functions in currency markets to even major geopolitical news has considerably shortened."" in short, when left-field events hit, not only can algos scan and react swiftly to newsfeed, many now can gauge the potential asset price impact. the most sophisticated can be ""trained"" to learn from the experience before the next shock. one currency trader familiar with algo use said a machine reading coronavirus cases would typically buy stocks if informed of ""500 new cases, 10 deaths"". ""if it's '3000 new cases, 200 deaths' they might sell. ""the point being that as soon as a headline is out, the machine-led market is trading on it,"" the trader said, speaking on condition of anonymity. but the machines had 'vol triggers', he said, meaning they can stop trading when the market moves beyond specified limits. how it works simple first- and second-generation programmes merely broke down large buy/sell orders into chunks to minimise market impact. now algos can be hooked up to sophisticated language processing technology, to ""read and analyse"" news feeds, then react accordingly, all in the space of seconds, said antony foster, head of g10 fx trading at nomura. however this can ""lead to overreaction in the first instance"", foster warned. the impact in fast-moving markets can be outsized if the models rapidly push prices towards existing buy/sell order levels, trip them and trigger other orders. that's what happened when news broke of iran's jan. 8 attack, according to a quant fund manager, who said algos had bought yen with the aim of triggering larger buy orders once a key option barrier was tripped. a plausible comparison may be the 0.6% plunge in the s&p 500 within the space of half an hour on jan. 29. the move came after american airlines and lufthansa said they were suspending their china flights, but an hour later, the losses had been recouped. stephane malrait, ing bank's head of market structure and innovation, says in such instances algos are programmed to check if moves are in line with price trends. if the swings are in response to the an incident, human traders can step in to smooth out the trade, malrait added. next, the algos may gauge the seriousness of the incident based on patterns of investor behaviour and economic consequences that followed previous such episodes. after the iran missile attacks, the message from the specialised data-crunchers to the algos was: stand down. one was geoquant, a u.s. firm which monitors geopolitical events and models the asset price impact. ""we modelled our iranian geopolitical indicator back to seven years... and put the current tensions against that backdrop,"" said geoquant ceo mark rosenberg, who concluded the risk would subside, with minimal oil price impact. another firm, predata, applied its machine-reading algorithm to last september's attacks on saudi oil facilities, which had raised fears of a regional war. to predict what might happen next, the programme compares interested parties' online attention to a subject, with the media coverage it receives, predata ceo hazem dawani said. the saudi event elicited little reaction from military officials and policymakers. ""the amount of news was far more than the amount of attention being devoted on the particular subject by investors, politicians, companies directly impacted by them,"" dawani said. he concluded - rightly - that there would be no escalation. virus unknowns executives at half a dozen firms providing risk analysis for algo strategies told reuters their services were increasingly in demand, but declined to give figures. but they acknowledged limitations. reactions to the coronavirus for instance could be hobbled because the only meaningful precedent is the 2003 sars epidemic which also coincided with the u.s. invasion of iraq. second, the pathogen and its dangers are relatively unknown. rosenberg said geoquant's china health risk index was at record highs. that has pushed up the firm's social instability risk index for china, pressuring chinese markets. however, he said this correlation breaks down beyond short periods. ""the longer-term relationship between chinese health risk and equities, chinese or global, is basically zero,"" he said.

south korea reported four more cases of the new coronavirus friday, bringing the total number of infected people to 11 as the country struggles to contain the outbreak that is sweeping across the world.
according to the korea centers for disease control and prevention (kcdc), the eighth case involved a 62-year-old south korean woman who visited wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, and came home on jan. 23. it said information on the other three are being checked and will be released in the future.
the announcement comes just hours after the public health agency confirmed the country's seventh case involving a 28-year-old south korean man who visited wuhan and returned via the chinese port city of qingdao on jan. 23.
but he did not show any related symptoms upon arrival at incheon international airport, west of seoul.
the patient complained of a mild cold three days later and visited a clinic tuesday when he had a fever at which time doctors checked him for the novel virus. the patient was quarantined immediately.
the kcdc said it is trying to track those who have been in contact with him.
seoul has tightened its quarantine rules and started to check everyone that returned from wuhan, regardless of any signs of the illness.
common symptoms of the coronavirus include fever, sore throat and breathing difficulties, with more acute cases involving chills and muscle pain.
the country's health authorities said 368 south koreans were brought back from wuhan, and 18 were moved to hospitals for monitoring as they showed symptoms, such as fever.
the evacuated nationals will be taken to public facilities and held for 14 days during which time they will not be allowed out or to meet visitors, they said.
the health ministry said that doctors at the sites will check them regularly, with all to be checked again before they are allowed to leave.
south korea confirmed its first case of the new strain of coronavirus on jan. 20. on thursday, the country reported two more cases, with one believed to be potentially the country's first person-to-person transmission.
worldwide, 9,805 cases had been reported in 22 countries as of early friday, with 213 people dying from the illness so far. (yonhap)",[],2020-01-31T08:25:00.000+02:00,2020-01-31T15:33:23.015+02:00,,0.0,16.0,0.0

klein told afp he wishes to assist the regional french community. some 500 french nationals are enrolled in the country’s consulate in wuhan.
french automobile giant psa and renault have factories in town, and the regional universities operate exchange programs with institutions in france.
not many french nationals are departing — a few for family or professional reasons, and many others don’t wish to spend 14 days in quarantine upon their return to france.
however, klein, a father of four that has been established in china for six decades, recommends that they do depart.
“the issue now is that the chinese physicians are now one hundred percentage mobilized in controlling this coronavirus outbreak, therefore there are tons of ways people can contract other ailments or diseases,” that the metz indigenous said.
“it might therefore not be suitable at this time to attend a chinese clinic under these conditions. that is why i strongly suggest the french people in wuhan return to france.”
the coronavirus has ignited fear of a broader, global epidemic. along with controlling the flow of individuals from affected areas in china, face masks also have been made compulsory in several locations, such as wuhan.
many shops in large cities such as beijing have run from inventory in recent days.
however, klein suggests maintaining the outbreak in outlook.
he says it is important to keep in mind that the influenza” can kill around 550,000 people on earth in 1 year” in ordinary times.
“i use the mask frequently when i move out. it is a responsibility imposed by the regional government, so everybody here in wuhan is wearing a mask,” he explained.
nonetheless, it’s largely ill men and women who must utilize the mask,” so they don’t spread the virus”.
“psychologically, it is a fascinating thing, wearing a mask. obviously, it is reassuring and it likely prevents you from putting your palms to a mouth,” he added.

the new coronavirus, 2019 n-cov, continues to spread in china, and cases are being diagnosed in many other countries, including the u.s. in some of those countries , including germany and vietnam, people who have not visited china have been diagnosed . the initial symptoms of coronavirus resemble other diseases, so many people are wondering how to know whether to seek medical help. 1. with the new coronavirus now in the u.s., am i at risk?
the biggest risk factors for being infected with the new coronavirus are travel to china, particularly wuhan and other areas of hubei province, and close contact with a person who has a suspected or confirmed n-cov case. without those risk factors, the chance for the general american public of catching this virus is low.
however, the outbreak is rapidly changing, and it is unclear how the situation in the u.s. will evolve in upcoming weeks. 2. what are the symptoms of 2019 n-cov?
most cases of 2019 n-cov have had fever and signs of pneumonia, like cough or shortness of breath. in some cases people are not able to breathe on their own and require the use of a ventilator. a small percentage of people die. 3. what should i do if i have any of these symptoms?
if you experience any of these symptoms within 14 days of travel to china, or within 14 days of coming in close contact with an individual infected with the coronavirus, you should immediately call your health care provider. it is best to call ahead before going to a clinic or emergency room. see also when will there be a coronavirus vaccine? 5 questions answered
your health care provider will evaluate you with the help of your state’s public health department and the federal centers for disease control and prevention . if your travel history and reported symptoms fit with n-cov infection, you may be tested for the virus. right now that test can be performed only at the cdc, so your health care provider would send samples to the cdc for testing. 4. what else could it be?
at this time of year many respiratory viruses are circulating in the community, including influenza, rsv , rhinovirus and human coronaviruses, which are different from the 2019 n-cov virus. it is much more likely that you have one of these viruses than the 2019 n-cov virus, even if you have traveled to china. 5. so there are other coronaviruses?
yes. there are four human coronaviruses that circulate each year in the u.s. they cause 10% to 30% of upper respiratory tract illnesses in the u.s., with mild symptoms akin to the common cold. health care labs can test for these coronaviruses — but not for 2019 n-cov.

geneva, jan. 30 (xinhua) -- world health organization (who) director-general tedros adhanom ghebreyesus said thursday that the novel coronavirus outbreak has become a public health emergency of international concern (pheic).
speaking at a press conference after a closed-door meeting of the emergency committee, he stressed that the who disfavors or even opposes imposing travel or trade restrictions on china.
under the international health regulations (ihr), the who director-general has the authority to determine that an outbreak constitutes a pheic when certain conditions are met. the designation is aimed at mobilizing more international resources to deal with the epidemic.
since the ihr entered into force in 2007, the who has made multiple pheic declarations.
ghebreyesus noted that chinese president xi jinping personally commands and deploys the prevention and containment efforts.
""the speed with which china detected the outbreak, isolated the virus, sequenced the genome and shared it with who and the world are very impressive, and beyond words. so is china's commitment to transparency and to supporting other countries,"" he said.
""in many ways, china is actually setting a new standard for outbreak response,"" he added.
that reflects not only china's high sense of responsibility for the lives and health of its own people, but also its strong support for global disease prevention and control, he said.
ghebreyesus said he believes that china will effectively contain and eventually defeat the epidemic, adding that china's efforts to combat the disease deserve respect and appreciation, and are worth learning.
in fact, many of the prevention and containment measures china has taken far exceed relevant requirements for dealing with emergencies, and the measures china has taken are good not only for that country but also for the rest of the world.
now the situation is still developing and more research is needed, and particularly countries with fragile health systems should enhance their responses, said the who chief.
that is the main reason behind the pheic declaration, he said, adding that considering global health security, it is also a necessary step to achieve a scientific, rational and calm response based on evidence, and to help other countries take scientific, reasonable and appropriate measures to prevent the epidemic.
wu zunyou, chief epidemiologist of the chinese center for disease control and prevention, said that the pheic declaration is a standard practice of the who.
""china's current prevention and control measures are the strictest and very effective. we are confident that we can effectively contain the epidemic and finally overcome it,"" wu said.

japan has so far reported no deaths from the virus that has killed more than 200 people in china.
organisers have hesitated to say much for several days, but on friday they addressed the rumours, as did the international olympic committee.

“we have never discussed cancelling the games,” tokyo organisers said in a statement to the associated press. “tokyo 2020 will continue to collaborate with the ioc and relevant organisations and will review any countermeasures that may be necessary.”
rumours of a cancellation have spread in japan with reports that the swiss-based ioc has met the world health organisation about the outbreak. the who has called the virus a global emergency.
“preparations for tokyo 2020 continue as planned,” the ioc said in a statement. “it is normal practice for the ioc to collaborate with all the main un agencies, as necessary, in the lead-up to the games and this naturally includes the who.”
tokyo governor yuriko koike, speaking earlier in the week to the heads of 62 municipalities, warned about the dangers of the outbreak. japan has also urged citizens not to travel to china.
“we must firmly tackle the new coronavirus to contain it, or we are going to regret it,” she said. morning rush hour in tokyo (jae c hong/ap)
rumours have spread online with thousands of comments on twitter under the hashtag in japanese “tokyo olympic cancelled”.
the ioc has faced challenges like this before, and carries insurance for such possibilities. it has cancelled olympics during wartime, and faced boycotts in 1980 and 1984. it also held the 2002 winter olympics in salt lake city, months after the 9/11 attacks in the us.
the mosquito-borne zika virus also cast a shadow over the run-up to the 2016 olympics in rio de janeiro.
the larger problem for the olympics could come with qualifying events in china and elsewhere being cancelled or postponed. international federations will have to reschedule events and chinese athletes could present extra challenges and screening.
world athletics, the governing body of track and field, announced earlier in the week it was postponing the world indoor championships in nanjing, china, until next year. the event had been scheduled for march 13-15.
travel, screening and allaying fears are certain to be more complicated if the outbreak continues. the 11,000 athletes expected to compete at the tokyo olympics will also face pressure to stay safe.
sponsors and television networks who have invested billions of pounds will also try to keep the games on track.
demand for olympic tickets in japan is unprecedented, exceeding supply by at least 10 times. organisers say 7.8 million tickets are being issued.
organisers say they are spending about £96 billion to put on the games, but a national audit bureau says the full cost is twice that figure.","['http://www.facebook.com/2008/fbml', 'http://facebook.com/2008/fbml']",2020-01-31T13:21:00.000+02:00,2020-01-31T15:55:37.000+02:00,,0.0,24.0,0.0

the trailing year has been challenging for ford motor company (nyse: f ) and that’s reflected in the company’s stock price. ford stock trades at almost the same level as it was in january 2019. while there are positives to talk about, i believe that headwinds are likely to dominate headlines in 2020. i therefore remain neutral on ford stock but would consider gradual exposure if the stock trades around $8. source: r.classen / shutterstock.com
the vehicle sales outlook for 2020 is the first reason to believe that the year will be challenging for ford. according to agl, the analytics subsidiary of truecar (nasdaq: true ), light vehicle sales for 2020 will likely come in around 16.9 million units. this implies a decline of 0.8% as compared to 2019.
for china, vehicle sales are projected to decline by 2% for 2020 to 25.3 million units . the impact of coronavirus on gdp growth and consumer confidence is still to be discounted in these numbers. even on a consolidated global basis, vehicle sales are expected to decline for the third consecutive year . therefore, conditions will remain challenging for the industry and ford will feel the impact. a crucial year in china
for 2019, ford reported a decline in sales of 26.1% as compared to 2018 . as a broad market trend, japanese and german brands have “weathered the slowdown better than local and american ones.”
as challenging conditions sustain, 2020 to 2023 are the most crucial years for ford in china. in particular, the year 2020 will dictate the likely trend.
to elaborate, ford will be launching 30 new models in china over the next three years . this is possibly the last attempt to revive sales and gain market share. it is also important to mention that one third of the models will be electric cars. compare brokers
there is no doubt that china’s electric vehicle market has potential in the long-term. but the market is already over-crowded and ford’s strategy remains to be seen. additionally, new energy vehicle sales declined by 4% in 2019 due to subsidy cuts .
with a weak macro-economic environment and high level of competition, ford has a big challenge ahead. ford is bullish on china for 2020 and 2021 in terms of cutting losses . however, if china’s sales fail to revive in 2020, ford stock can potentially trend lower. trucks will continue to drive cash flows
even amidst challenges and losses in china, ford reported operating cash flow of $14.7 billion for the first nine months of 2019.
the key cash flow driver for ford is the company’s robust truck sales in the u.s. for fourth-quarter 2019, ford reported 15.9% growth in truck sales on a year-on-year basis. sales growth was driven by the f-series coupled with the ranger.
back in 2018, morgan stanley analyst adam jonas estimated that f-series sales were responsible for 90% of ford’s global profits . the scenario is no different in 2020. truck sales have provided the company with cash flow cover as it continues to invest in china.
even for 2020, i believe that f-series sales will remain strong as the trend is sharply shifting in favor of pick-ups in the u.s. car sales for ford slumped by 41% in q4 2019, with truck sales surging by 15.9% for the same period. my final views on ford stock
ford stock remaining sideways in the trailing year is an indication of the markets being in a “wait and watch” mode. truck sales in the u.s. will continue to impress, coupled with commercial vehicle sales in europe.
however, ford’s plans for china and its impact on growth will trigger stock movement. i am afraid that it’s likely to be a difficult year considering the broad industry outlook. therefore, it makes sense to stay on the sidelines.
if china’s growth plans do work, there will be opportunities in the coming quarters to consider exposure to ford stock.

once again, it’s that time of the week when i sit down in front of the keyboard with some hot coffee in one of my favorite mugs and try to connect the dots of what’s going on in the world. but this time, my thinking is pretty scattered, or at least more so than usual.
my mind seems to be filled up with so many random thoughts with none of them particularly related to each other. kind of like the wicker basket in the kitchen, which has car keys, several letter openers (including a broken one), doggie prescriptions, and whatever else that lands in it. nothing deplorable there, unlike some of the things swirling in my mind.
the shocking news of kobe bryant’s death with his daughter and seven others brought to light that we, as a society, still have a problem dealing with what’s been swept under the rug. discussion of the sexual assault he was accused of back in 2003 started almost as soon as news of his death was made public. even with the changes in our sensibilities in those intervening years, it’s clear we have a long way to go in dealing honestly and fairly with celebrities who offer, shall we say, a mixed legacy.
ken starr showed up front and center at the impeachment trial this week in defense of trump. ken starr? really? the same guy who defended jeffrey epstein against charges of statutory rape in 2007? the one who worked on that sweetheart deal for 13 months on work release with a stay in the private wing of the palm beach jail? sure, even epstein deserved legal defense, but starr’s support of christopher kloman, a retired teacher and friend of the family, after his admission of molesting five female students is a bit beyond the pale. (starr asked the court for leniency; kloman got 43 years in prison.)
the icing on the cake came at baylor university, when starr as president and chancellor mishandled several sexual assault cases and was removed as president followed by his resignation as chancellor a few days later. but we all know starr’s real claim to fame was his role as independent counsel during the clinton administration. his defense of trump included publicly contradicting himself from 20 years ago and bemoaning that we live in “the age of impeachment.” he wailed, “how did we get here?” well, you may have been driving, mr. starr.
while one can use a broom to sweep bryant’s and starr’s past under the rug, it requires a bulldozer for john bolton. to enumerate everything he has said and done over the course of his career that have made him anathema to democrats would try our collective patience. so we’ll just stick with his super-hawkishness. he has advocated for regime change in cuba, iran, libya, north korea, venezuela, and yemen, and he doesn’t mean “wouldn’t it nice if the people overthrew the government?” regime change. when trump tweeted, “if i listened to him, we would be in world war six by now,” that’s probably true. of course, even that contradicts what trump had previously said about bolton, but consistency is not one of trump’s virtues.
now that bolton seems willing to provide testimony in the impeachment trial that could prove damaging to trump, the old warmonger has found his way under the bus that keeps rolling over everyone who has, or even may, break ranks with the white house. but that’s okay.
some democrats seem eager to put their eggs in the bolton basket (oh, that basket again). even adam “i’m no fan of john bolton, but i like him a little more now than i used to” schiff seems to be willing to—if not crawl into bed with—at least transact a little business with him. oh, adam, maybe you’re doing the right thing. but, to reframe and paraphrase something bolton himself once said, you want a butterfly. do you intend to put lipstick on a caterpillar and call it a success?

the online row is the latest flashpoint in a long-standing debate around taiwan — the self-ruled island considered by china to be one of its wayward provinces — one which canadian prime minister justin trudeau has freshly waded into.
this week, the international civil aviation organization (icao), which is based in montreal, blocked numerous critics on twitter who were voicing calls for taiwan and taiwanese experts to be included in discussions around the outbreak of a new coronavirus.
in one case, a consultant was surprised to find he was blocked after only retweeting another user’s post calling for taiwan’s participation.
melbourne-based journalist mike yeo said he was blocked immediately after commenting that the volume of people being blocked made the un agency seem “thin-skinned, while their action towards taiwan counterproductive to aviation safety.”
neither the icao nor the world health organization recognizes taiwan’s sovereignty and will only work directly with beijing.
speaking to loud cheers at a parliamentary session wednesday, trudeau reiterated ottawa’s call for taiwan’s involvement.
“we support taiwan’s meaningful participation in international multilateral forums, especially when its presence provides important contributions to the global public good (and) … is in the best interests of the international health community,” he said.
you might be interested in... some of the academics involved told the star the icao’s moves to “silence” their suggestions have ramifications for the safety of about 60,000 canadian nationals who live in taiwan.
as the host country for the agency, they say canada has a special stake in the issue and they applauded trudeau’s response.
“we understand the nuance behind how the un can and cannot engage with taiwan … (but) in light of the coronavirus, channels should be explored to allow information-sharing with taiwan authorities to ensure that the virus can be contained,” said jessica drun, a washington, d.c.-based taiwan-china expert at the project2049 think tank.
in her tweet to the icao, drun had noted that taoyuan international airport in taipei is a major transportation hub and that there are frequent flights between taiwan and mainland china.
taiwan also has a number of medical professionals who can make contributions, she said, before the icao account blocked her.
icao is bound by a un general assembly resolution recognizing the people's republic of china based in beijing as the lawful government of china, but taiwan under the name ""chinese taipei"" has been an invited guest to an icao assembly in 2013 following approval from beijing, drun noted.
you might be interested in... most criticisms have centred around whether it makes sense for taiwan — as a major air-travel hub in asia — not to have direct access to the agency to contribute in the fight against the coronavirus, which emerged in wuhan, china, in late 2019.

the body responded to criticisms on twitter by stressing that “inaccurate, compromising or offensive material” will be blocked from posting to its social media accounts and linking to an updated social media policy .
on thursday, the who declared the outbreak a global emergency after the number of novel coronavirus cases spiked tenfold in a week and has spread to more than a dozen countries. the backlash against icao’s handling of online discussions has been particularly swift in washington and among taiwanese people this week.
“silencing voices that oppose icao’s exclusion of taiwan goes against their stated principles of fairness, inclusion, and transparency,” the u.s. house foreign affairs committee said in a statement.
u.s. republican sen. marco rubio’s office on twitter called the move “outrageous” and “another sign that the chinese communist party’s efforts to pressure and bully international organizations to bend to its demands are working.”
another academic who was recently blocked by icao for his comments, taipei-based researcher j. michael cole, told the star that “the targeting of professionals who were asking legitimate questions is unacceptable.”

he commended canada’s statements and said ottawa can also encourage other member states to “signal their discontent with the manner in which icao has dealt with this matter.”
in a statement, icao communications officer william raillant-clark said there has been “mischaracterization of icao and icao’s activities by external parties.”
he said an “advocacy campaign” has fostered false claims that the icao is motivated to exclude any part of the world from access to public health and transport advice.
in response to the star’s question about why taiwan is not able to directly take part in icao deliberations on best aviation practices during regular meetings open to its 193 international members, raillant-clark said: “to the best of our understanding, (new icao standards and updates) are all being promptly shared by china with all of the applicable aviation stakeholders and officials in its sovereign territories.”
china sees taiwan as a province that should be part of the country again, and has proposed that taiwan join under a “one country, two systems” similar to the arrangement in semi-independent hong kong and macau.
taiwan president tsai ing-wen has rejected the offer, repeatedly vowing to protect taiwan’s sovereignty and safeguard freedom and democracy on the self-ruled island. however, china suspects tsai and her democratic progressive party of pushing for taiwan’s formal independence, last year threatening war should it make such a move.
hong kong has been hit by months of anti-government protests triggered by widespread resentment of what many city residents see as relentless efforts by beijing to exert control despite promises of autonomy.","['https://www.icao.int/Newsroom/Pages/social-media.aspx', 'https://icao.int/Newsroom/Pages/social-media.aspx']",2020-01-30T02:00:00.000+02:00,2020-01-31T04:25:45.004+02:00,,0.0,23.0,0.0

“we have initiated a series of measures to tackle the emergency; contact tracing, case isolation, quality care and community engagement are being done diligently. care must be taken so that rumours do not spread on social media. we are closely monitoring the situation. we need to be cautious, but there is no need to panic. our health network is capable of handling emergencies,” said vijayan.
shailaja said those who returned from countries where ncov cases were confirmed should skip public gatherings. “though we tracked down most people who came from regions with ncov cases through airports, there are others who did not report before health department. they should immediately visit the nearest health centre. most students and others, who came from china, reported to the nearest health centres,” she said.
the health machinery is well equipped to prevent the spread of the virus and the department needs the support of the people who returned from these regions. people should realize that self-quarantine is the key to control the spread of the virus, the minister said.
“community spread is the major fear factor. the virus has spread in china’s community. the virus transmission was from human to human. hence, we must prevent the spread of virus in the community,” said indu ps, who heads the department of community medicine at thiruvananthapuram medical college hospital.
virus, from the student who tested positive, should be contained. already three people who were closely associated with the student have been isolated and admitted at the general hospital. their blood and swab samples have been sent for testing, she said.
dr indu said that people who were closely associated with the student in college and family members will also have to be screened now. “ the threat is less since the student was isolated when she developed sore throat. hence, chance of the virus spreading among people is less,’’ she said.
the minister said that control rooms have been set up in all districts and people who have any kind of symptoms like fever, cough or sore throat should immediately contact the control rooms.

hong kong (reuters) - hong kong leader carrie lam rejected calls from a medical union on friday to close the border with mainland china to contain the spread of the new coronavirus, and urged health staff not to go through with a threatened strike.
the recently formed hospital authority employees alliance said earlier on friday 6,500 of its members would go on strike if the frontier stayed open, a day after the world health organization (who) declared the virus a global emergency.
the who recommended all countries try to prevent or reduce cross-border spread of disease, which originated in the central chinese city of wuhan. but it said measures should avoid unnecessary interference with trade or travel.
""i am afraid (closing the border) contradicts the who suggestion ... which asks governments not to take any measures that may fuel discrimination,"" lam told a news conference.
she announced a raft of new measures against the disease and said any industrial action by medical staff would only make the situation worse.
""at the end of the day those who will suffer will be our hong kong citizens and the public health system,"" she said.
authorities have announced 12 confirmed infections in hong kong but no deaths. the number of confirmed cases in china has risen beyond 9,800, beijing's envoy to the united nations in vienna said, and 213 people have died, all in china.
lam said that on jan. 30, only 9.7% of arrivals into hong kong, excluding those at the airport, were from mainland china, and most of the rest were returning hong kong citizens. she said she expected the flow to shrink as many mainland cities were under lockdown.
about 37,000 hong kongers crossed the mainland border the other way into china that day, she said.
new measures
the health scare comes after months of often violent anti-government protests in hong kong triggered by fears its high degree of autonomy, guaranteed under a ""one country, two systems"" formula, is being eroded by beijing. the central government denies meddling.
protesters frustrated by the government's refusal to make concessions on demands for full democracy have in recent months formed about 40 unions to keep up the pressure on the authorities.
in a news conference earlier on friday, winnie yu, the chairwoman of the hospital authority employees alliance, said its members may go a strike next week unless the border was closed. other new unions have pledged support.
lam had previously ordered the suspension of the high-speed rail service between the city and mainland china and all cross-border ferry services, but the unions said it was not enough.

the coronavirus has now been found in at least 20 countries since the outbreak began last month, with the philippines and india being the latest countries to report cases. it's expected to keep growing: respiratory virus experts in hong kong say they believe the outbreak's peak is still months away, likely in late spring.

""i think it's quite likely that you will see human-to-human transmission in u.s. cities"" within weeks, cowling said – but it only took a matter of hours for his prediction to come true, as the centers for disease control and prevention announced thursday that the first human-to-human spread had occurred in illinois.
a chinese passenger who fell ill aboard a cruise ship in italy was determined not to have the coronavirus thursday – a finding that gave relief to more than 6,000 people aboard the carnival cruise line-owned costa smeralda. italy's health ministry says the tests it performed on samples from the woman and another passenger were negative.
the ship had returned to its italian home port of civitavecchia thursday morning, at the end of a seven-day cruise through tourism-heavy areas such as marseille, barcelona and mallorca. but instead of disembarking, the passengers were told to stay onboard until tests could determine whether the passenger, a 54-year-old woman from macau, was carrying the virus.
the ship's medical staff placed the woman and her traveling companion into isolation in the costa smeralda's shipboard hospital wednesday night after suspecting that she might have the coronavirus, costa cruises tells npr.

mhms condemns speculation on social media
by alfred pagepitu
the ministry of health and medical services (mhms) has rubbished speculation on social media that the coronavirus has reached solomon islands that ministry has done nothing over the monitoring at the honiara international airport.
medical authority is on full alert, monitoring procedures have been ratcheted up at air and sea ports and all other points of entry, and health officials are on hand to check all inbound passengers for signs of illness
health officials expressed to island sun yesterday that speculation on social media that the coronavirus has reached solomon islands was “fake news”.
they said information on any confirmed cases would be made known by the ministry of health and responsible people to the people.
“we are working with officials at the airports and ports and screening everyone coming into the country,” they said.
“so if we have any confirmed case, we will advise through the mainstream media or inform the public the virus is reaching our shore, but at the moment solomon island is still safe.
“please do not believe everything you read (on social media),” one officer said.
“we already have a team in communication with all hospitals and clinics throughout the nation.
“any information on confirmed cases will be released through health authority,” he said.
in a statement released yesterday, mhms permanent secretary, pauline mcneil said that considering a number of nearby countries had already recorded suspected cases, the likelihood of coronavirus appearing in the solomon islands could not be ruled out.
ms mcneil advised the ministry has already formed a technical working group including experts from the world health organization and the united nations children’s fund (unicef).
“essential medical supplies to handle cases of 2019-ncov are also being mobilised and development partners are standing by with additional resources should these be needed,” she said.
“we want to reassure everyone – both local people and travellers heading to the solomon islands – that we are preparing for that possibility,” ms mcneil said.
“as a ‘first line’ of defence mhms is working with immigration and customs officials at ports and airports, training them on how to recognise cases of 2019-ncov.
“incoming visitors will be provided with guidance on what to do if they think they have the infection.”
in the meantime, she said everyone should remain alert for signs or symptoms of the disease especially if they had visited wuhan, hubei province, china in the past 15 days or had come in close contact with anyone returning from affected countries showing similar symptoms.

the closest case to georgia is in illinois.
92 other possible cases were still being tested.
more than 1,000 cases have been confirmed in china.

(source: walb) “we should all be concerned about the coronavirus, but i think it’s way too early to be worried or to panic,” dr. ruis explained.
the symptoms can include fever and lower respiratory symptoms.
dr. ruis said there's no cure and no vaccine as of now.
many people diagnosed are surviving, but it's more severe and can even be deadly for older people and people with compromised health.
for now, they're only concerned about people who have traveled to china in the last two weeks or those who have symptoms after having close contact with someone who is being tested for coronavirus or has been diagnosed with coronavirus.
dr. ruis said georgia health experts are ready to respond if a case were to be confirmed in the peach state.
""it's also comforting to know that we prepare for things like this,"" he said. ""we drill for things like this.""
dr. ruis said as we learn more about the coronavirus over the next couple weeks, he expects health experts and officials to develop their guidelines to better respond to this outbreak.

according to her facebook profile, helen chen is student of australian national university (anu), and is currently based in canberra. like many young people her age, she reposts videos of cats doing cute things, some memes, and photos of herself with friends.
after a year away from family, she visited wuhan for the chinese new year, a highly anticipated and celebrated occasion in chinese culture to be with family. the coronavirus outbreak has left her stranded in the province, unable to return back to australia to resume university. as distressful as that situation is, there was something else on her mind that she felt she had to address.
“i’m one of the millions in wuhan right now who is affected by this,” chen started in a facebook post published on jan. 26, “it is heartbreaking to see comments here saying how we deserve it.”
at the time this article was being written, chen’s original post had been shared by over 30,000 users, and had over 45,000 reactions. the comments are a mix of kind words of support, and others that continued to blame “your [her] people” with expletives and harsh language from people around the world, including our filipino countrymen.

“the coronavirus is taking away the only time of the year that families get to reunite,” chen continued in her post, “these selfish exotic traders have taken away precious family time from all these people who are literally putting their lives in danger to help others, and yet on the internet, these unsung heroes are being lumped together with them, criticized, condemned, and humiliated. it’s really heartbreaking. those people don’t deserve any of it.”
the examples she mentions, taken from her firsthand account, are the healthcare professionals voluntarily working around the clock and risking their lives, the hotels around are offering free accommodation to them, stores providing free hot meals, the construction workers rushing to build new facilities so they can tend to the ill, and such.
“i hope i’m not coming off as playing the victim. i’m merely trying to tell my side of the story. and i’m sorry the virus has now spread to other countries. i truly am very sorry,” chen ends her post, “but not all chinese people are bad.”
facebook user and author of the post, helen chen
while the philippines has erupted in, reasonable, fear and concern over the virus, that does not and should not mean we can forget about empathy and common human decency. it should be in the face of adversity that people, no matter their race, ethnicity, age, gender, or other identifying factors, come together to support each other, and especially the victims.
and yet, this recent test has brought out the worst in some people, who may hide in the comfort of social media to post and comment things that perpetuate derogatory stereotypes and involve some underlying racism against our fellow humans. with the thousands of confirmed cases of the virus, the majority are in china, with families worried about their ill loved ones, or have lost them during a time of celebration. but some commenters say they don’t care about “their” new year.
if there is any silver lining to the words of hate, is that it engages others to react, calling out negative attitude and racist remarks.
“dear fellow filipinos,” commented one facebook user, “you better keep your mouth shut if you have nothing good to say.”
chen followed up with a post on jan. 28, writing, “when i wrote my first post, i was just angry at the generalization and cruelty directed at anyone who’s chinese. […] i didn’t think many people would care about what i had to say. but the attention it gained indicates otherwise. i think if i could change the opinion of only one person, or perhaps not even change their opinion but just inform them about something they wouldn’t have been otherwise be aware of, i’d be really happy.”

the world health organization announced thursday that the outbreak of a deadly and fast-spreading strain of coronavirus constitutes a global health emergency.
""over the past few weeks, we have witnessed the emergence of a previously unknown pathogen, which has escalated into an unprecedented outbreak and which has been met by an unprecedented response,"" who director-general tedros adhanom ghebreyesus told reporters in geneva.
however, tedros was adamant that ""the main reason for the declaration is not because of what is happening in china but because of what is happening in other countries. ... let me be clear — this vote is not a declaration of no confidence in china."" he said that the who is deeply concerned about what will happen if the virus begins spreading in countries with weak health systems and that the purpose of the declaration is to help those countries.
the declaration of a global health emergency can work to galvanize international funding. according to the who's procedures , the three criteria for such a declaration are that it is an ""extraordinary event,"" that it ""constitute[s] a public health risk to other states through the international spread of disease"" and that it ""potentially require[s] a coordinated international response.""
the last time the who announced an international health emergency was in july 2019 over the ebola outbreak in the democratic republic of congo. before that, international emergencies were declared in 2016 for the zika virus and in 2014 for the ebola outbreak in west africa.
the new coronavirus has sickened around 9,800 people worldwide and killed at least 213 , all of them in china.
the who said in a statement that ""all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, contact tracing and prevention of onward spread"" of the virus.
""there is no reason for measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade. who doesn't recommend limiting trade and movement,"" tedros added. but the who also said that in certain circumstances, such as when there are many cases of transmission among a vulnerable population, such measures could be ""temporarily useful.""
the coronavirus drew worldwide attention after chinese authorities began reporting cases of pneumonia in the city of wuhan last month. they were able to pinpoint the cause to a previously unknown strain. other forms of coronavirus, such as sars and mers, have been responsible for past international outbreaks.
health authorities believe this particular strain, known as 2019-ncov, likely first spread from an animal. china's national health commission has said it is associated with exposure at a seafood market in wuhan that also sold live animals.
since then, the virus has spread from wuhan to countries around the world, including the united states, japan, singapore and thailand. ""the vast majority of those cases are still associated with travel to wuhan,"" said dr. michael ryan, executive director of the who's health emergencies program.
""we know that this virus can cause severe disease and that it can kill, although for most people it causes milder symptoms,"" tedros told reporters last week. the who said that about 20% of those infected experience severe illness .
experts find the new coronavirus particularly concerning for several reasons. first, the who said there is evidence that the virus could spread from human to human. ""the disease is mainly a respiratory disease passing via droplets from one person to another and mostly still through close contact,"" ryan said.
the droplets could come from sneezing, coughing or even talking. this is worrying because it is easier for a virus to spread quickly between humans compared with a virus transmitted from an animal to humans. human-to-human transmission has now been documented in three countries outside china, tedros said.
second, experts still don't know for certain what animal the virus originated from in wuhan. ""until we know what the animal is, there potentially could still be animals being sold in markets all across china that is spilling virus over into people,"" matthew frieman, a virologist with the university of maryland school of medicine, recently told npr's nurith aizenman .
and third, chinese authorities say the virus has also infected medical workers — people who already would be taking serious precautions to protect themselves.
there is currently no targeted drug to treat the virus, chinese health authorities said. and there is no vaccine to guard against it. tedros is calling on countries to ""accelerate the development of vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics.""
several countries, including the u.s., have started to evacuate citizens from wuhan because of concerns about the coronavirus. as npr's bill chappell reported , american passengers broke into cheers after their flight from wuhan touched down tuesday night in alaska. the centers for disease control and prevention is advising that travelers ""avoid all nonessential travel to all of [china].""
major airlines, such as united airlines and british airways, have suspended flights to chinese cities.
chinese health authorities recently announced new sweeping measures to try to contain the new coronavirus by implementing a strict quarantine on wuhan, a city of some 11 million people. ""there's no sense of when the quarantine might be lifted,"" npr's emily feng reported from beijing. ""the big problem is that people are going to have to return to work soon, when the lunar new year is over. many of them are coming from villages where there are very few screening measures for the virus.""
china's government has come under criticism for not responding more quickly to the outbreak. but who officials have praised the chinese response.
""the chinese government is to be congratulated for the extraordinary measures it has taken to contain the outbreak, despite the severe social and economic impact those measures are having on the chinese people,"" tedros said. ""in many ways, china is actually setting a new standard for outbreak response."" copyright 2020 npr. to see more, visit https://www.npr.org. loading...","['https://npr.org/2020/01/29/800725903/china-confirms-nearly-6-000-cases-of-coronavirus', 'http://en.nhc.gov.cn/2020-01/29/c_76036.htm', 'https://npr.org/2019/07/17/742510946/who-declares-ebola-outbreak-in-congo-an-international-health-emergency', 'https://npr.org.', 'https://apps.npr.org/dailygraphics/graphics/coronavirus-spread-map-20200122/map_no_numbers.html', 'https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/28-01-2020-who-china-leaders-discuss-next-steps-in-battle-against-coronavirus-outbreak', 'https://who.int/ihr/procedures/pheic/en/', 'https://npr.org/2020/01/29/800761987/coronavirus-americans-cheer-as-evacuation-flight-from-wuhan-reaches-u-s', 'https://www.apps.npr.org/dailygraphics/graphics/coronavirus-spread-map-20200122/map_no_numbers.html', 'https://www.who.int/emergencies/zika-virus-tmp/en/', 'https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6', 'https://www.npr.org/2020/01/29/800761987/coronavirus-americans-cheer-as-evacuation-flight-from-wuhan-reaches-u-s', 'https://www.npr.org/2020/01/21/798252815/judging-the-potential-threat-of-the-wuhan-coronavirus', 'https://www.npr.org/2020/01/29/800725903/china-confirms-nearly-6-000-cases-of-coronavirus', 'https://bbc.com/news/uk-51292590', 'https://who.int/news-room/detail/28-01-2020-who-china-leaders-discuss-next-steps-in-battle-against-coronavirus-outbreak', 'https://www.who.int/ihr/procedures/pheic/en/', 'https://www.who.int/emergencies/zika-virus-tmp/en', 'https://www.who.int/ihr/procedures/pheic/en', 'https://www.npr.org/2019/07/17/742510946/who-declares-ebola-outbreak-in-congo-an-international-health-emergency', 'https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-51292590', 'https://who.int/emergencies/zika-virus-tmp/en/', 'https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/s0128-travelers-avoid-china.html', 'https://www.gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6', 'http://www.en.nhc.gov.cn/2020-01/29/c_76036.htm', 'https://cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/s0128-travelers-avoid-china.html', 'https://npr.org/2020/01/21/798252815/judging-the-potential-threat-of-the-wuhan-coronavirus', 'https://www.npr.org.']",2020-01-30T22:03:00.000+02:00,2020-01-31T01:35:23.040+02:00,,0.0,51.0,0.0

canada is seeking chinese approval to send a plane to the locked-down city of wuhan to collect the 196 canadians who have asked for help to leave. trudeau said the government is co-ordinating evacuation efforts with other countries.
“it is a deliberate process in which we are engaged responsibly,” trudeau said friday.
myriam larouche, a 25-year-old from l’ascension, que., who is in wuhan studying tourism management at the central china normal university, said she received an e-mail friday morning from the canadian government telling her to be ready to leave.
“they still don’t know the date and the time but it’s probably going to be in the next day or two,” said larouche in a video call with the canadian press from her dormitory. “i hope so.”
she said she was also told that she’d only be allowed to take one carry-on bag with her on the plane.
she was going to get the bag ready friday afternoon, – a welcome change to her routine since the lockdown, which includes practising her chinese, exercising, studying, watching netflix and chatting with her mother back in canada.

american airlines said it was taking precautions against the virus but had no immediate comment on the lawsuit. on wednesday it announced flight cancellations from los angeles to beijing and shanghai starting next month, but is continuing flights from dallas.

the american airlines pilot lawsuit came as an increasing number of airlines stopped their flights to mainland china, including air france klm sa, british airways, germany's lufthansa and virgin atlantic.
other large carriers have kept flying to china, but protective masks and shorter layovers designed to reduce exposure have done little to reassure crews.

""the eu promotes practical solutions regarding taiwan's participation in international frameworks wherever this is consistent with the eu's ""one china"" policy and the eu's policy objectives. this applies to the who,"" battu-henriksson said.

except for the specific reference to the coronavirus outbreak, the statement was nearly identical to past expressions of support for taiwan's participation in the world health assembly, the decision-making body of the who.
in a statement issued friday, mofa thanked the eu and noted that the united states, japan and canada have also recently expressed support for taiwan's inclusion in the who.
""as the development of the wuhan coronavirus outbreak makes clear, there should be no gaps in global virus prevention efforts,"" the statement said.
despite the shows of international support, taiwanese authorities have not been invited to emergency meetings held by the who on the ncov) outbreak, due to the body's affiliation with the united nations, which does not recognize taiwan.
when the issue of taiwan's exclusion came up during a who press conference on wednesday, michael ryan, the head of organization's health emergency programme, suggested that taiwanese experts are being included at an unofficial level.

the latest government advice came in the wake of widespread reports about panic buying of face masks and shortages.
however, those who are sick with symptoms of upper respiratory infections, and individuals with chronic diseases are advised to wear a surgical mask when outdoors, especially when visiting crowded places, said cdc deputy head chuang jen-hsiang (莊人祥).
chuang made the remarks when asked by reporters whether it is necessary to wear a faces mask as a precaution against 2019-ncov, following a statement to that effect by vice president chen chien-jen (陳建仁) the previous day.
despite an announcement from the cabinet that starting thursday the government would provide 4 million masks every day to help meet demand and pledges of sufficient supply, there has been an escalating number of complaints about being unable to buy face masks.
although masks are now being made available through convenience stores and other medical supplies chain stores with each person allowed to purchase a maximum of three masks at a time per store, stocks are running out rapidly in many places.
cabinet spokeswoman kolas yotaka said friday that the main issue was one of logistics not supply, as the country only recently concluded a seven-day lunar new year longbreak.
the situation is being dealt with and the government is working closely with related authorities and the private sector to improve the logistical difficulties so masks will be more readily available soon, she stressed.
meanwhile, the government warned sellers of surgical masks that they will face fines if they are found to be hoarding supplies or inflating prices.
those who inflate prices face a maximum fine of nt$50 million for violating article 40 section 1 of the fair trade act, while anyone found hoarding supplies face a maximum sentence of seven years in prison for violating article 61 of the communicable disease control act.
also friday, the cdc said the total confirmed cases of 2019-ncov remained at nine in taiwan.
a total of 838 suspected cases of the novel coronavirus have been reported in the country as of friday, 102 of which were reported thursday, according to the latest statistics.
of those, 583 have been ruled out as coronavirus cases, with 239 still under quarantine, according to the center.
the world health organization on thursday designated the coronavirus outbreak that originated in wuhan, china a public health emergency of international concern. currently, other than china there have been about 100 confirmed cases in nearly 20 countries.

nbc news – facebook will start removing misinformation about the coronavirus outbreak from its platforms. in a blog post late thursday, facebook head of health kang-xing jin said the firm would “remove content with false claims or conspiracy theories that have been flagged by leading global health organizations and local health authorities that could cause harm to people who believe them.” “this includes claims related to false cures or prevention methods — like drinking bleach cures the coronavirus — or claims that create confusion about health resources that are available,” jin said. he added that instagram would also ban or restrict hashtags and conduct “proactive sweeps” to remove content spreading misinformation about the virus. the move comes after the world health organization (who) declared a global health emergency over the fast-spreading virus, which has infected more than 9,809 people in china, killing 213. it’s not the first tech platform to start taking action over the outbreak however, with google and twitter also taking steps to tackle misinformation about it. google for instance has started displaying information from the who about the virus in search results while its video-sharing platform youtube is promoting videos on it from credible sources. twitter meanwhile has adjusted its search prompt to lift information from “authoritative health sources” to the top of the page when users make searches about the coronavirus. facebook has gotten into hot water over how it deals with health-related disinformation in the past. the social media giant was criticized for failing to remove anti-vaccination posts last year, instead opting to lower such content in the rankings of people’s feeds. it announced a partnership with the who in september aimed at steering users toward accurate vaccination information from the united nations’ health agency. facebook’s latest move on countering misinformation comes as the company faces intense regulatory scrutiny around the world, an issue that has weighed heavily on the company’s share price of late. the firm lost as much as $50 billion in market value this week after reporting a rise in expenses on the back of privacy and security updates. the company said thursday that it would continue working with independent fact-checkers to limit the spread of false coronavirus claims and instead show accurate information on its platform. it will also run educational pop-ups with “credible information” and share data with researchers to help them forecast the spread of the virus. “not all of these steps are fully in place. it will take some time to roll them out across our platforms and step up our enforcement methods,” said jin. “we will provide updates on additional steps we are taking in coordination with global and regional partners as the situation continues to evolve.”","['https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=TWTR', 'https://cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=FB', 'https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=FB', 'https://about.fb.com/news/2020/01/coronavirus/', 'https://cnbc.com/2019/09/05/who-partners-with-facebook-stop-the-spread-of-inaccurate-vaccine-information.html', 'https://www.about.fb.com/news/2020/01/coronavirus/', 'https://cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=TWTR', 'https://about.fb.com/news/2020/01/coronavirus', 'https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/29/facebook-fb-earnings-q4-2019.html', 'https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=GOOGL', 'https://cnbc.com/2020/01/30/who-declares-china-coronavirus-a-global-health-emergency.html', 'https://cnbc.com/2020/01/29/facebook-fb-earnings-q4-2019.html', 'https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/05/who-partners-with-facebook-stop-the-spread-of-inaccurate-vaccine-information.html', 'https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/', 'https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/30/who-declares-china-coronavirus-a-global-health-emergency.html', 'https://cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=GOOGL']",2020-01-31T15:29:00.000+02:00,2020-01-31T18:55:47.000+02:00,,0.0,16.0,0.0
